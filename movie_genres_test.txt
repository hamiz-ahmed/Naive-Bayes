She gets to know her latex and wooden travelling partners along the way, and with them deconstructs herself and her lost love in this ventriloquial docu-mocumentary requiem.  Ken Campbell was a hugely respected maverick of the British theatre, an eccentric genius who would snort out forgotten artforms. Nina was his prodigy in ventriloquism and has been said to have reinvented the artform. This film is truly unique in genre and style. No one has seen ventriloquism like this before.  Nina Conti's funny, highly original and poignant documentary, takes us on two journeys. A personal journey, and a professional one, through the strange, surprising and often hilarious world of ventriloquism. When Nina was just another twenty-something wannabe actress, Ken presented her with a teach-yourself ventriloquism kit. This set her on a path to becoming a sell-out act in Britain and abroad, with a clutch of major awards.  On the road, Nina brings all the puppets to life as struggles to meet the conflicting demands of her old acerbic partner Monkey, and the new characters she has been bequeathed. But one puppet remains silent. Ken's doll of himself sits mournful and judgemental in the hotel bedroom. Nina cannot find her master's voice and until she does, she will not be able to lay her old life to rest.  Never has watching someone talk to themselves been this interesting.

The film first aired on 19 July 2007 on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. The documentary was filmed over the course of a year. Dresden Gaede, the twins' toddler half-sister and April Gaede's parents, Bill and Dianne, also appear in the documentary. In a change from a previous documentary featuring the duo, Louis and the Nazis by Louis Theroux, Nazi Pop Twins was without humorous irony. Filmed mainly in low-light, indoors and/or in winter, it stresses tension between the twins and their mother, April — manager and driving force behind the band — and the stress the white nationalist ideology has put on grandparents Bill and Dianne's relationship to the point where Dianne threatens to leave Bill during the making of the program. It also touches on the fact that this ideology seems to have been a factor in the breakup of mother April's marriage, which also happens concurrently to the making of the program.

The film is set in the city of Vaslui, and centers on a group of characters who revisit the Romanian Revolution of 1989 which brought an end to the communist regime.

When a journalist overhears Budhia urge Natha to “do what needs to be done” for the sake of their families, a media frenzy ignites around whether or not Natha will commit suicide.

Comedy	My Year Without Sex is an Australian drama film written and directed by Sarah Watt, opening the 2009 Adelaide Film Festival and given wider release in May 2009. Set in Altona, it is about a 30-something couple, Ross and Natalie, and their children Ruby and Louis, after Natalie suffers a ruptured brain aneurysm and is advised not to have sex for 12 months. Watt has said that after her first film Look Both Ways, she wanted to make a film "without a sex scene": I didn't want to be coy and just avoid it, but once we started playing with that title, the whole thing became about sex. My ideas were so broad, about anxiety and non-sustainable consumerism and how a non-ruling-class family were coping with how to save for the future and the uncertainty in the work force. And sex seemed a good way to corral it. A lot of our consumerism is about looking sexually attractive or being anxious. My Year Without Sex received strongly favourable reviews, and was touted by The Sydney Morning Herald as "possibly the best" Australian film of 2009 as well as "the most accomplished" local film of 2009 by The Age.

Those interviewed include a gay Nazi; gay porno movie stars; spokespersons from the Gay Activists Alliance and its more conservative counterpart, the National Gay Task Force; leaders of the mattachine society; the founders of the Daughters of Bilitis; and novelist John Rechy, who defends gay male promiscuity against the director’s contention that what is hurting the gay men’s movement is the obsession with “discos”, baths, and orgy bars”.

Science Fiction	"The Chinese are the main pork-eaters in predominantly Muslim Indonesia. They're also the default scapegoats when anything goes wrong socially, politically or economically. Edwin, director of brilliant shorts, devotes his debut feature to the Chinese-Indonesian experience in all its contradictions. For some, being Chinese is like having a firecracker go off in your mouth; others may think it's worth submitting to sodomy to help acquire a 'pure' Indonesian identity. The film's centripetal structure radiates out from Linda (Ladya Cheryl), the daughter of a dentist who ruined his own sight when he tried to change the shape of his eyes, and a volleyball champion who retired and became a pious Christian. Elements in play include a gay couple with all the right connections, a documentary about the anti-Chinese riots of May 1998, and Stevie Wonder's most irritating song. Often surreal, humorously deadpan and sometimes disturbing."  Quoting Tony Rayns

Comedy	Ceremony is a 2010 comedy film directed by Max Winkler.  "What to do when the woman of your dreams, Uma Thurman’s Zoe, is about to get married to another guy? According to Sam (a fast-talking and decidedly precocious Michael Angarano), the “solution” is to crash the wedding of said ex-girlfriend, insinuate yourself into the weekend’s festivities, throw a lot of balls in the air, and see where they land…   Debuting director Max Winkler’s irreverent comedy eschews a standard A-to-B-to-C narrative in favor of a series of situations that highlight the comedic talents of Angarano and Thurman. This loose structure also allows for a steady stream of wisecracking dialogue before gradually revealing that maybe Sam and Zoe are not the ideal couple the former thinks they could be. While Thurman is the only veteran in the cast, Ceremony introduces us to a wide-range of up-and-comers: in addition to Angarano, both Lee Pace (A Single Man) and Reece Thompson (Rocket Science) provide eye-opening performances. And Winkler’s adroit handling of scenes ranging from the wacky to the poignant marks him as one to watch as well." Quoting the description from the 2011 Palm Springs International Film Festival site.

Documentary film	Cannibal Tours is a 1988 documentary film by Australian director and cinematographer Dennis O'Rourke. While it borrows heavily from ethnographic modes of representation, the film is a biting commentary on the nature of modernity. The film follows a number of European and American ecotourists as they travel from village to village throughout the Sepik River area in Papua New Guinea, driving hard bargains for local handcrafted items, paying to view formerly sacred ceremonies and taking photographs of every aspect of "primitive" life. With some prodding, the tourists unwittingly reveal an unattractive and pervasive ethnocentrism to O'Rourke's cameras. The tourists thus become somewhat dehumanized by the camera, even as the tourists themselves are busy exoticizing even the most mundane aspects of Sepik River life. The title of the film can be read in at least a couple of ways. At one point early in the film, a German tourist, clearly titillated, describes the bygone practice of raiding and cannibalism. Cannibalism, the viewer also learns, was highly symbolic and often involved taking and wearing the skins of the victims.

Comedy	Crime Wave is a 1985 film made by Winnipeg-based filmmaker John Paizs shot between 1984 and 1986. The film is an homage to late 1940s-early 1950s "color crime pictures". Paizs plays Steven Penny, a struggling screenwriter who lives above the garage of a suburban family, and begins typing each night from the moment the street lamp comes on. Everything we learn about the character comes from Kim, the family's daughter, who has a schoolgirl crush on him, as Penny never utters a word in the entire film. Steven is able to write beginnings and endings, but not middles, and we are treated to some of these amusing endings and rather repetitive beginnings that introduce several characters from various geographic regions to settle upon the film's hero "from the North". The film is designed to emulate the look and feel of educational films from the period. Randolph Peters includes a flute and glockenspiel-based score emulating such films. When Steven Penny is brought into some shady deals, the film takes on more of a neo noir look and sound, inflected with surrealism. One of the film's signature images is of the street lamp smashed over Steven's head, which he wears home.

Comedy	The Crimson Permanent Assurance is a short film that plays as the beginning of the feature-length motion picture Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. Although it is presented as a separate film, and is sometimes shown without the feature, it can also be considered a prologue to The Meaning of Life, which is almost never shown without The Crimson Permanent Assurance preceding it. Having originally conceived the story as a 6-minute animated sequence in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, intended for placement at the end of Part V, Terry Gilliam convinced the other members of Monty Python to allow him to produce and direct it as a live action piece instead. According to Gilliam, the film's rhythm, length, and style of cinematography made it a poor fit as a scene in the larger movie, so it became "Our Short Feature Presentation", to be shown ahead of the "Main Feature". It was a common practice in British cinemas to show an unrelated short feature before the main movie, a holdover from the older practice of showing a full-length "B" movie ahead of the main feature. By the mid-1970s the short features were of poorer quality, or simply banal travelogues.

Thriller	For Your Eyes Only is the twelfth spy film in the James Bond series, and the fifth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It marked the directorial debut of John Glen, who had worked as editor and second unit director in three other Bond films. The screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson takes its characters and combines the plots from two short stories from Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only collection: the title story and "Risico". In the plot, Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents. Some writing elements were inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the science fiction-focused Moonraker, the producers wanted a conscious return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach, and an unusually strong narrative theme of revenge and its consequences.

Griffith's 1916 film Intolerance. The film was shot in this manner as a kind of insurance for the Studio.

The film was edited by Noriko Miyakawa and mixed by Dean Hurley. Idem Paris was shot on high definition digital video, presented in black-and-white and released on YouTube. Critics drew comparisons between Idem Paris and Lynch's debut feature film, 1977's Eraserhead, noting that both had "high-contrast black and white images, the focus on specific machinery, and the clanking and hissing array of sounds." Describing the background of the film, Lynch said: Hervé Chandès from the Fondation Cartier brought me over to Idem and introduced me to Patrice Forest. I see this incredible place, and I get the opportunity to work there. And this was like a dream! It just opened up this brand-new world of the lithography and the magic of lithography, the magic of the stones. And it was a great, great thing! This thing of lithography, this channel of lithography opened up and a bunch of ideas came flowing out and it led to about a hundred lithographs.

Documentary film	"Who was the real Anne Lister? See one version of her story in Frameline34’s engaging Opening Night film, The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister. Then follow comedy writer Sue Perkins as she guides you through this dry-witted documentary, digging up even more of the real dirt on a British lesbian who was well ahead of her time.  Born to a landowning family in Halifax in 1791, Lister lived in the same era as the Bronte sisters, but her writings — and, boy, did she write — were a far cry from Wuthering Heights. In a series of elaborate and often encrypted diaries (“The Rosetta Stone of lesbian history,” says her biographer), Lister detailed every one of her sexual relationships.  It took over four million words to capture her dalliances, beginning at the ripe young age of thirteen with her roommate at an elite girls’ boarding school (from which she, naturally, was sent home in short order). Journeying across the Yorkshire countryside, Perkins attempts to trace the life and loves of Lister, from her experimental youth to her radical industrialist-landowner days with her live-in lover (okay, wife).  Thanks to the meticulous decoding efforts of Lister’s biographer, Helena Whitbread, and the insights of a handful of local historians and scholars, Perkins is able to paint an intriguing picture of a complex character, who is at once pioneering, self-serving, rebellious, manipulative and bold — but certainly never boring." Quoting Joanne Parsont from the 2010 Frameline 34 - SF LGBT Film Festival site.

Documentary film	"Duki Dror (My Fantasia, SFJFF 2005; Taqasim, SFJFF 2003) is a documentary filmmaker who embraces his subjects with a keen eye and curious intellect. In this creative homage, Dror illuminates the life of German Jewish Expessionist architect Erich Mendelsohn. The visionary Mendelsohn, a contemporary of Walter Gropius and influenced by artists such as Franz Marc and the Blue Rider group, produced work embodying a kind of organic dynamism. His story unfolds through letters exchanged with his wife, Luise, an accomplished cellist. Dror gently breathes life into the correspondence of two passionate artists who helped each other weather a turbulent time in history. Mendelsohn’s career followed the jagged trajectory of many German Jewish émigrés fleeing Nazism; he worked in England, Israel and, finally, the Bay Area, where he taught at UC Berkeley. Mendelsohn’s drawings pulsate with energy and his buildings are stunning. Among his accomplishments, he designed the Einstein Tower, Schocken department stores and the Universum Cinema in Germany; the Mt. Scopus Campus of Hadassah Hospital and the Weitzman House in Israel; and private homes and a hospital in the Bay Area. Dror deftly juxtaposes the architect’s original designs with contemporary images, weaving in reflections from Mendelsohn’s granddaughter, other architects and the people who use these unique structures today—a testament to the integrity and timelessness of visionary design." Quoting Nancy Fishman from the 2011 San Francisco Jewish Film Festival site.

All of the lessons learned from making The Old Mill would subsequently be incorporated into Disney's feature-length animated films, especially 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Comedy	Devils on the Doorstep is a 2000 Chinese black comedy film directed, co-written and produced by Jiang Wen, starring Jiang himself, Kagawa Teruyuki, Yuan Ding and Jiang Hongbo. Shot in black and white to mimic old-time war movies, the film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May and clinched the Grand Prix but was subsequently banned in its home country. Inspired by the novel Survival by You Fengwei, Devils on the Doorstep is set in the last years of the Second Sino-Japanese War during World War II and tells the story of a Chinese villager who is forced by a mysterious figure to take custody of two prisoners from the Japanese Army. Fearing both the mystery man and the Japanese, the village falls into a dilemma over what to do with the two prisoners. Contrary to its title, Devils on the Doorstep is not at its core an anti-Japanese war film. In Jiang's own words, the film shows how Chinese literature and film has perpetuated an attitude of blaming the aggressor and casting the Chinese population as passive victims of aggression. Jiang hopes that the film illuminates this common human psychological trait of blaming others for disaster that goes beyond Chineseness.

It made money and this and that, but it really is not me anymore. I think many other people could have done that. I don't think many people could have made RoboCop that way, or either Starship Troopers. But Hollow Man, I thought there might have been 20 directors in Hollywood who could have done that. I felt depressed with myself after 2002."
Documentary film	Addicted in Afghanistan is a 2009 documentary film written by Jawed Taiman and Sharron Ward and directed by Jawed Taiman.  "There are more than a million drug addicts in Afghanistan, including a shockingly high percentage of children. Addicted in Afghanistan, the feature-length debut of director Jawed Taiman, is about the teenagers Jabar and Zahir, both of whom are from Kabul and come from families that have been ravaged by drugs. Zahir used opium for the first time when his drug-addicted mother gave it to him at age eight, and the two boys spend their days looking for their next heroin score. The film sketches an intimate portrait of their lives in the slums of the city, where they smoke heroin in their decrepit houses or leave the detox clinic for the umpteenth time. But there are also some lighthearted moments, such as when Jabar and Zahir exuberantly pull the legs of passersby in broken English in the opening scene. And between the lines, the political situation of their broken country also gets adequate attention: while Jabar and Zahir blame the Americans for introducing heroin to Afghanistan, Zahir's mother knows better -- it was the Taliban that got her addicted. Taiman does not try to maintain an objective distance, but makes passionate attempts from behind his camera to change Jabar and Zahir's literally hopeless lives." Quoting the synopsis from the 2010 International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam site,

Documentary film	"Framed by the hate crime murder of 16-year-old Fred Martinez, this riveting documentary explores the diverse histories of gender and sexuality in Native American cultures.  In 2001, 16-year-old Fred Martinez was brutally murdered in the small town of Cortez, Colorado. A poor Navajo teenager, Fred was also nádleehi, a person with both masculine and feminine essences. Fred's determination to express this identity, which is revered in his culture, ultimately cost him his life. Two Spirits inspirationally elevates Fred's story from a hate crime tragedy into a deeper exploration of Native American cultures that embrace diversity in human gender and sexuality. It deftly weaves heart-wrenching interviews with Fred's mother, Cortez community members, and civil rights leaders into a largely unknown indigenous history, illuminating topics from native gender expression and same-sex marriage to the legacy of colonialism that impacts native LGBT communities. Rare archival footage, golden photography of the American Southwest, and a score by Navajo composers contribute to this riveting film that will open your mind and hearts to the spiritual possibilities of difference.

Comedy	8 Women is a 2002 French dark comedy musical film, written and directed by François Ozon. Based on the 1958 play by Robert Thomas, it features an ensemble cast of high-profile French actresses that includes Danielle Darrieux, Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle Béart, Fanny Ardant, Virginie Ledoyen, Ludivine Sagnier, and Firmine Richard. Revolving around an eccentric family of women and their employees in the 1950s, the film follows eight women as they gather to celebrate Christmas in an isolated, snowbound cottage only to find Marcel, the family patriarch, dead with a knife in his back. Trapped in the house, every woman becomes a suspect, each having her own motive and secret. Ozon initially envisioned a remake of George Cukor's 1939 film The Women, but eventually settled on Thomas's Huit femmes after legal obstacles prevented him from doing so. Drawing inspiration from Cukor's screwball comedies of the late 1930s and the 1950s work of pioneering directors such as Douglas Sirk, Vincente Minnelli, and Alfred Hitchcock, 8 Women blends farce, melodrama, musical, and murder-mystery film while addressing murder, greed, adultery, and homosexuality.

Documentary film	"In 1977, during the last military dictatorship, Osvaldo Cacciatore's de facto government proposed an ambitious Urban Highway Plan for the city of Buenos Aires. Out of the eight highways that were planned only two were built; a third one, the AU3, or Central Highway, left an inheritance of expropriations all along its route through several neighborhoods: Villa Urquiza, Saavedra, Villa Ortúzar, Chacarita, Belgrano "R"... That urban scar dotted with empty lots and half-demolished houses soon became the best homes low income families could find. Three decades later, the AU3 has added some new chapters to its series of deferments, neighbor wars, and failed plans of recovery. Hartmann shapes a precise portrait of one of the great urban and social debts of Buenos Aires by going through that strange frontier with open eyes and ears, listening to its inhabitants and the people responsible, as well as critics and specialist on the subject."

Original footage of a farming community, 60 miles west of Minneapolis, Minnesota was filmed in 1979 for a PBS documentary.

Documentary film	In the early 1990s, Seattle was the focal point of an emerging musical underground. The Gits helped spearhead this new scene. Their sound was proto-grunge and all-out punk aggression. The earnest, blues wail of front woman Mia Zapata was its center. Mia was the very embodiment of riot grrrl intensity, talent, and humanity. Her uncompromised integrity epitomized a way of life that influenced an entire generation of female artists to follow. Upon returning from a successful European tour -and at the height of The Gits' popularity- singer Mia Zapata was found raped and murdered, unfairly abbreviating the band's fable. Incredibly, more than a decade later, new evidence would surface, Mia's case file would be reopened, and a suspect would be brought to justice -as cameras rolled.The Gits is an account of overcoming adversity, addiction, love, loss and pain. It's a punk rock mystery, but not merely a tale of tragedy. It's the mythic story of a great American Rock N Roll band.

Comedy	What's Up, Tiger Lily? is a 1966 comedy film directed by Woody Allen in his feature-length directorial debut. Allen took a Japanese spy film, International Secret Police: Key of Keys, and overdubbed it with completely original dialogue that had nothing to do with the plot of the original film. By putting in new scenes and rearranging the order of existing scenes, he completely changed the tone of the film from a James Bond clone into a comedy about the search for the world's best egg salad recipe. During post-production, Allen's original one-hour television version was expanded without his permission to include additional scenes from International Secret Police: A Barrel of Gunpowder, the third film in the International Secret Police series, and musical numbers by the band the Lovin' Spoonful. This experience helped convince Allen that he should secure creative control for all his future projects. The band released a soundtrack album. Louise Lasser, who was married to Allen at the time, served as one of the voice actors for the "new" dialogue soundtrack, as did Mickey Rose, Allen's writing partner on Take The Money and Run and Bananas.

When he is approached with a business proposition by an attaché from Sieger Co, Denmark's largest oil and shipping corporation, Martin Vinge (Lars Mikkelsen), a former hard-nosed reporter and now 'the best headhunter in the country', sees a potentially controversial and yet highly lucrative professional opportunity. At a confidential meeting NF Sieger (Henning Moritzen), the elderly incumbent Sieger CEO, seemingly unsatisfied with the qualities of his son and heir apparent Daniel, challenges Martin to find him a worthy successor. Although previously burned by a professional and very public scam, and unwilling to be drawn into anything which may add further complications to his already complex life, Martin rapidly finds himself manipulated into acquiescence. As he learns more about the company, Martin begins to wonder just who it is he is working for, and whether he can trust any of his professional and personal contacts. This is a stylish thriller, expertly paced with unrelenting plot twists and political machinations. With a sharp look, intelligent writing and strong performances, Headhunter is a welcome confident addition to the recent wave of outstanding Danish thrillers like King's Game and The Candidate."

Animation	In this television special, Rudolph has just come back from delivering Christmas presents with Santa Claus when he is asked by Father Time to find the next Baby New Year before midnight on New Year's Eve. The baby, named Happy, was humiliated and laughed at constantly by everyone he met because of his large ears and thus ran away. Unless Happy is returned in time to take his position as the new year, the old year won't end and the date will perpetually remain December 31 forever. Father Time speculates that Happy is hiding out in the Archipelago of Last Years, where the Old Years retire and rule over an island styled to resemble the year they ruled over. Sent to assist in this journey are agents of Father Time: General Ticker, a military clock; and The Great Quarter Past Five, a camel with a large timepiece in his hump. Rudolph first travels to the island belonging to One Million B.C. or "O.M." for short. O.M. is a caveman whose island is anachronistically inhabited with friendly dinosaurs. After unseen visits to the islands of 1492, 1893, 1965 and 4000 B.C., Rudolph and O.M. head for the island of Sir 1023, a knight whose island is filled with medieval trappings and fairy tale characters. They then travel to the island of 1776, which reflects Colonial America and is ruled over by "Sev" (1776), who resembles Benjamin Franklin. Sir 1023 and Sev join Rudolph and O.M. on their quest along with "Big Ben", a whale with a clock attached to his tail. As Rudolph and his friends search for the baby, they repeatedly encounter the villain of the special, a giant buzzard named Aeon. Aeon is destined to live for exactly one aeon after which he will turn into ice and snow. Since his aeon will end at the turn of January 1, he plans to kidnap Happy to prevent the year from ending and thus prevent his predestined death on January 1. Eventually, Aeon captures Happy and takes him to the Island of No-Name, which is located "due north of the North Pole". Rudolph and his friends succeed in rescuing Happy from Aeon. Happy's large ears cause Aeon to laugh, thereby filling him with warmth and preventing him from turning to ice and snow. With Santa's help, Happy is brought to Father Time's castle just in time to begin the new year, which is designated "nineteen-wonderful".

Documentary film	"  In the Mexican penal system, one is guilty until proven innocent. This leads to a very uncomfortable reality: prisons full of people serving time for crimes they didn't commit. Presumed Guilty narrates the story of José Antonio Zúñiga Rodriguez, nicknamed Toño, who was mistakenly accused of murder and condemned to twenty years in jail for being poor and in the wrong place at the wrong time. His case would have been one of many unfortunate stories, but lawyers Roberto Hernández and Layda Negrete decided to get involved and publicize the injustice.  Hernández and Negrete gained recognition for a short documentary called The Tunnel, which provoked the release of an innocent man from prison. This film eventually led them to Toño's case, and after studying the court documents, they discovered that the lawyer representing him was working illegally with a forged licence. They were able to reopen the case and decided to film the new trial. Hernández and Geoffrey Smith (of The English Surgeon) then teamed up to bring Toño's story to the screen.  Presumed Guilty shows how Toño's strength and creativity help him through nearly three years of wrongful imprisonment. Courtroom scenes chillingly call to mind Kafka's The Trial, so absurd is the mindless bureaucracy in the judicial process. Toño is retried by the same judge who condemned him. The prosecutor is concerned only with the previous case file and has no interest in new information. The police officers refuse to co-operate, insisting they do not remember Toño's arrest. It is revealed that the only witness to implicate Toño had himself originally been accused of the crime, then learned of Toño through the police. Hernández and Negrete uncover a frustrating, labyrinthine legal system defended by mediocre civil servants and corrupt police officers.  Turning the lens on a dysfunctional legal system, Hernández and Smith show just how difficult it is to achieve any sort of justice. At a time when there is a strong push for the death penalty in Mexico, Presumed Guilty is important not only as a document of the system's flaws but as a vehicle for change." Quoting the program notes from the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival site.

Documentary film	The Fourth Estate: A Film of a British Newspaper is a 1940 documentary film directed by Paul Rotha. The film was sponsored by the owners of The Times, and depicts the preparation and production of a day's edition of the newspaper. The film is notable for the fact that it went unreleased. The Second World War broke out while it was in production, and the explanation for The Fourth Estate having been buried most commonly given by historians of the Documentary Movement is that following the film's completion, the Ministry of Information were reluctant to sanction its release on the grounds that it depicted life in peacetime London, which would no longer be accepted by viewers as realistic. However, Rotha himself claimed that the film's sponsor was reluctant to release The Fourth Estate in the belief that it implicitly criticised The Times from a leftist perspective, portraying it as the mouthpiece of the establishment. Another point of interest is that Carl Mayer, the Jewish and prominent Weimar screenwriter, who by this time was living in Britain as an exile from the Nazis, acted as a 'scenario consultant' to the film.
Thriller	"There is a cinematic storm brewing in the Balkans. A new wave of independent filmmakers from Serbia are pushing aesthetic and moral boundaries with films rooted in their own unique experiences. One prime example is A SERBIAN FILM, which hammered audiences into submission when it played as part of Fantastic Fest's 2010 SXSW programming. Now, Fantastic Fest is ready to unleash another controversial Serbian work upon U.S. audiences. Mladen Djordjevic’s LIFE AND DEATH OF A PORNO GANG is a graphic unflinching exploration of the extreme edges of art, sex, and violence.  It is 1998 in Serbia. The Kosovo war is in full swing. Marko (Mihajlo Jovanovic) is a film school graduate in search of a break. He gets a job as an assistant to a thuggish porno producer named Cane (Srdjan Miletic). Although he eventually is allowed to direct porn, Marko refuses to play by the rules. He combines an interest in art films, documentaries, science fiction and horror into a style called “socio-political porno horror.” Since Cane doesn't like his money being used for such experiments, Marko is forced to express himself in other ways. He assembles a group of porn actors, junkies, and misfits for a live sex show in Belgrade. After the first disastrous show, Marko piles the crew into a psychedelic love bus and take the porno escapades on the road. This is when the real trouble begins.  Marko begins his journey as a passive character focused on making films and art. He is given to abstract theorizing about sex and death (e.g. he posits that pornography is a battle between “Eros and Thanatos” in which Thanatos emerges as the victor) while his county is laid to waste by war. Once the setting moves beyond Belgrade, Marko transitions from a bystander to an active participant in the nation’s bloodshed. His philosophical justifications provide some cover for his deeds but his transgressions are really no different than that of the other criminals and opportunists that plague the country.   Mladen Djordjevic and cinematographer Nemanja Jovanov — who also shot A SERBIAN FILM — show great versatility in filming this story on a relatively low budget. The setup is done as a video diary with voice-overs. A more standard documentary style with handheld cameras eventually takes over. As the plot unfolds, the styles shift around. The approach is eclectic, but never superfluous. Everything locks together because these creative strategies are so tightly woven into the narrative." Quoting the program notes from the 2010 Fantastic Fest site.

The video starts with a scientist posing a question to the viewer, what is skateboarding? Then it cuts to a montage of the skaters in the video. As the video progresses it intercuts skits with the solo video parts of the skaters. These skits are meant to show how ludicrous peoples reactions to skateboarders are: in a crime ridden area with robbery, drugs, and prostitution, the one cop arrests a kid for skateboarding on the sidewalk. The skits also present the skaters in a "classy" scenario: Four skaters are in a parking lot dressed as golfers. They have caddies and golf bags with skateboards in them. The video is presented as a broadcast of a golf tournament with the quiet commentator marveling at the skill of the players. There are also interjections of a panel of people who oppose everything in the video, for example: saying,"That's not art," following a section with the skaters painting on a ramp. The video ends with a scooter race downhill.

Documentary film	"Director John Greyson’s operatic tour-de-force smashes conventional barriers of form and genre to reinvent the documentary. The protagonists of Fig Trees are two of the patron saints of AIDS activism: Tim McCaskell, a founder of the Canadian AIDS Action Now, who has been living with AIDS for 25 years, and Zackie Achmat, who went on a treatment strike in 1989, refusing to take anti-retroviral drugs until they were made generally available in South Africa. The story is a grand-scale narrative of personal heroism in the face of evil as personified by politicians and pharmaceutical company executives, with millions of lives hanging in the balance. The result is a postmodern pastiche of palindromes, queer history, music history, and Catholic theology (with an albino squirrel thrown in for good measure). Riffing off another famously queer opera, Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson's “Four Saints in Three Acts,” the film features a first-rate score by collaborator David Wall." Quoting the program notes from the 2010 Seattle Interntional Film Festival.

Antonio Banderas has a small role marking his film debut.

The plot follows a nymphomaniac pop star who falls in love with a gay Middle-Eastern prince. Their unlikely destiny is to find one another, overcome their sexual preferences and live happily ever after on a tropical island. Although badly received by Spanish film critics, Labyrinth of Passion was a modest success and quickly reached cult film status.

Comedy	Everybody Does It is a 1949 comedy film starring Paul Douglas, Linda Darnell and Celeste Holm. In the film, a businessman's wife tries to become an opera star, failing miserably due to her lack of talent. When it turns out that her totally untrained husband is found to have a marvelous singing voice and goes on tour under an assumed name, his wife is livid. Darnell sings long stretches of an imaginary opera, L'Amore di Fatima. The music for it was written by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. In a little tongue-in-cheek detail, the poster for the opera lists Tedesco – who wrote real operas — as the composer. To add to the illusion of the opera's authenticity, Douglas also sings some known songs, including a musical setting of the Rudyard Kipling poem Mandalay and the Toreador Song from Carmen. The operatic scenes were staged by Vladimir Rosing. The film is a word-for-word remake of 1939's Wife, Husband and Friend, which starred Warner Baxter as Borland, Loretta Young as his wife, and Binnie Barnes as Cecil Carver.

Documentary film	"“We were raised to believe in resistance, persistence, and confrontation. That’s why I know I can handle anything.” So says one of the women in Quest for Honor, a searing and necessary documentary about the still-prevalent practice of honor killings in the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq. Kurds number more than 26 million and are believed to be the largest ethnic group in the world without their own country. Despite much progress politically and economically, honor killings are routinely cited as the major human-rights violation among Kurds. Since 1991, statistics suggest that more than 12,000 women, mostly between 13 and 18, have met a gruesome death at the hands of relatives, usually the men of the family, who are convinced the victim has impugned the family’s honor. The film centers on cases taken up by the Women’s Media and Education Center in Sulaimaniyah, Kurdish Iraq. Texas-based photographer and author Mary Ann Smothers Bruni’s film marks her evolution from still photographer to filmmaker. While the deaths themselves are shocking in their sheer brutality, perhaps more striking is the ease with which the men involved in the killings speak about their unforgiving attitudes toward the victims. Deeply disturbing, yet profoundly hopeful, in its belief that change in centuries-old attitudes is possible, Quest for Honor asks us to imagine a day when women everywhere can live in honor, and not fear for their lives." Quoting the 2009 Sundance Film Festival site.

Documentary film	"“What does ‘bear’ mean to you?” asks Bear Nation of the gay men who identify as bears, chase them, and everyone else who wonders what it’s all about. This insightful exploration from the director of Festival favorite doc Small Town Gay Bar swings from heterosexual ignorance to the superficially obvious, then digs deeper into an emotional identification for queer men who felt marginalized… at least until they found others who fit their aesthetic.  The journey begins with reflections of gay bears. For most, there was a dual coming out process, starting with the acceptance of being gay and then experiencing a lack of acceptance in the queer community due to body image. These men then share heart-felt stories of their second coming out: finding other big, hairy guys. The focus broadens to a “community” of bears, high-lighting Chicago’s annual Bear Pride and clubs like London’s XXL that helped transform the bear movement into a celebrated subculture. This hirsute image has even reached mainstream media. Hetero standup comic Kevin Smith, who passes for bear, candidly and humorously shares his appreciation for the bear image on Tonight with David Letterman and with us.  Acclaimed director Malcolm Ingram deftly guides us from the experience of being lonely and believing a negative self-image to finding acceptance in a big way. The strength, courage and passion of a bear are unmistakable, and those of us watching get brought into the fold." Quoting Marcus Wonacott from the 2010 Frameline 34 - SF LFBT Film Festival site.

Documentary film	Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis is a 1927 German film directed by Walter Ruttmann, co-written by Carl Mayer and Karl Freund. The film is an example of the city symphony film genre. A musical score for an orchestra to accompany the silent film was written by Edmund Meisel. As a "city symphony" film, it portrays the life of a city, mainly through visual impressions in a semi-documentary style, without the narrative content of more mainstream films, though the sequencing of events can imply a kind of loose theme or impression of the city's daily life. Other noted examples of the genre include Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's Manhatta, Alberto Cavalcanti's Rien que les heures, Andre Sauvage's Etudes sur Paris, Dziga Vertov's Man With a Movie Camera, and Alexandr Hackenschmied's Bezúčelná procházka. This film represented a sort of break from Ruttmann's earlier "Absolute films" which were abstract. Some of Vertov's earlier films have been cited as influential on Ruttmann's approach to this film, and it seems the filmmakers mutually inspired one another, as there exist many parallels between this film and the later Man With a Movie Camera.

Dicha dedicatoria decía así: "Con certo sentimento d´amore, alla signorina grossa e rústica".

The documentary features the abandoned grounds of Auschwitz and Majdanek while describing the lives of prisoners in the camps. Night and Fog was made in collaboration with scriptwriter Jean Cayrol, a survivor of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. The music of the soundtrack was composed by Hanns Eisler. Resnais was originally hesitant about making the film and refused the offer to make it until Cayrol was contracted to write the script. The film was shot entirely in the year 1955 and is composed of contemporary shots of the camps and stock footage. Resnais and Cayrol found the film very difficult to make due to its graphic nature and subject matter. The film faced difficulties with French censors unhappy with a shot of a French police officer in the film, and with the German embassy in France, which attempted to halt the film's release at the Cannes Film Festival. Night and Fog was released to very positive acclaim and still receives very high praise today.

Kennedy. The film first aired on January 6, 2006 on German television station Westdeutscher Rundfunk. It was directed by Wilfried Huismann.

Laurence Keenan, now 81, said it was "perhaps the worst investigation the FBI was ever involved in". "I realised that I was used. I felt ashamed. We missed a moment in history," Mr Keenan said. Veteran US official Alexander Haig told the filmmaker that Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B Johnson, believed Cuba was to blame and feared a pronounced swing to the right if the truth were known that would keep the Democrats out of power for a long time.

Science Fiction	Stake Land is a 2010 horror film written by Nick Damici, Jim Mickle and directed by Jim Mickle. ""Ain't nuthin' out there but sundown and 'them.'" -Mister America is a lost nation. When an epidemic of vampirism strikes, humans find themselves on the run from vicious, feral beasts. Cities are tombs and survivors cling together in rural pockets, fearful of nightfall. When his family is slaughtered, young Martin (Connor Paolo) is taken under the wing of a grizzled, wayward hunter (Nick Damici) whose new prey are the undead. Simply known as Mister, the vampire stalker takes Martin on a journey through the locked-down towns of America’s heartland, searching for a better place while taking down any bloodsuckers that cross their path. Along the way they recruit fellow travellers, including a nun (Kelly McGillis) who is caught in a crisis of faith when her followers turn into ravenous beasts. This ragtag family unit cautiously moves north, avoiding major thoroughfares that have been seized by The Brethren, a fundamentalist militia that interprets the plague as the Lord’s work. Director Jim Mickle first grabbed the attention of horror film fans with his zombie-rat thriller Mulberry Street, in which Damici also starred and served as co-writer. They have teamed up again to deliver an even darker and bloodier shocker. Drawing on the post-apocalyptic frenzy described by Richard Matheson (author of the novel I Am Legend) and George Romero, Stake Land is a road movie with fangs, similar in its phantasmagoric journey to Gareth Edwards’s Monsters (also featured in this year’s Festival). With indie horror director Larry Fessenden (The Last Winter) serving as producer, Stake Land excels in large part because of Fessenden’s choice to take bigger chances and make bolder choices in spite of budget limitations. Fessenden has been supportive of the new wave of indie American horror directors like Mickle, Ti West and J.T. Petty, who are making the most of their micro-budgets in ways that would stymie their Hollywood brethren. The story of a live boy in a dead world, Stake Land is a bloodcurdling mix of honest scares and gripping action." Quoting Colin Geddes from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.

Thriller	Maachis is a 1996 Indian Hindi film directed by Gulzar and produced by R. V. Pandit. The film stars Om Puri, Tabu, Chandrachur Singh and Jimmy Shergill in the lead roles. The title of the film is used as a metaphor that conveys that the youth of any nation are matchsticks that could get ignited due to the deficiencies in the political and policing systems. The film portrays the circumstances surrounding the rise of the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the 1980s and traces the transformation of a youth from a boy next door to a dreaded terrorist bent on wreaking vengeance. Maachis tasted critical and commercial success. Gulzar's direction and the music of Vishal Bhardwaj were strong points. To this day, many songs from the film, particularly "Chappa Chappa Charkha Chale" and "Chhod Aaye Hum Vo Galiyaan" can be heard playing on FM radio or TV channels. Bhardwaj went on to become a movie director and has directed movies such as Maqbool as well as the highly lauded Omkara.

It's based on the lines from King Lear: `As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods. They kill us for their sport'. One of the themes is: if there is a God, what if that God is a prick; what if that God is just a bastard? For one of the characters, when he thinks that, it all makes sense, it makes sense of the world, that the world is such a slimy world of greed and selfishness and anguish and pain that the only way that it can make any sense is if the person who created the whole thing is... it's all a macabre joke. It's almost the opposite of Genesis 1: `We were made in God's image and likeness'. If you say, `We are sinful, horrible, we're in God's likeness, therefore that's what God is like'.

Its success propelled Lombard into the front ranks of film comediennes. The film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2011.
Documentary film	Nothing on Earth is a 2013 documentary film directed by Michael Angus.
Comedy	This volume features Tom Hanks' work on Saturday Night Live, from his first appearance on the ill-fated '85-'86 season through the late nineties, but the majority of the material deals with the Hartman-Lovitz years, my personal favorite cast. Hanks and Lovitz, in particular, are paired quite often, especially in their frequent "Girl Watchers" sketches and an audience interview segment with Lovitz asking Hanks who his favorite performer on the show was (and he doesn't stop until he hears Jon Lovitz). Some of the stuff is familiar--the Wayne's World represented here is the Aerosmith one, and that and "Jew, not a Jew" were available on the videotape. However, there are a LOT of sketches here that will likely not see the light of day again, like Hanks, Damon Wayans, and others playing stand-up comics who deliver every line in their lives like a stand-up act, the really funny "Five-Timers" sketch, which centers around an exclusive club where five-time hosts reside (with SNL poking a little fun at its rarefied image), and a sketch where Hanks plays a loving husband that occasionally fantasizes that his wife is dead.

Documentary film	"Boy Interrupted is a film that raises questions. It asks how a young boy can end his life at the tender age of 15. It struggles to find answers about what kind of family he had and the life he led. By its very nature, it is a naked display of its filmmaker's personal life at its most revealing and perhaps disturbing. How can a mother, we may ask, make a film about the death of her son? What defines this film as a remarkably unique and truth-telling achievement is the way it explores how filmmaking can create closure for its creators as well as its audience. Dana Perry has gathered home movies, photographs, and a variety of different documents to tell the story of her son, Evan: his bipolar illness, his life, and his death, and their impact on those who loved him the most. She interviews his siblings and friends, his doctors and his teachers, and in the process, she chronicles a harrowing and difficult journey. The camera provides insight and revelation, and yet Boy Interrupted is a film that is also full of despair. The film's saving grace is that it functions, in the final analysis, as therapy for both its viewers and its subjects at a most fundamental level. It is an essentially human story, and a parent’s worst nightmare." Quoting the description on the 2009 Sundance Film Festival site.

Documentary film	"With so much emphasis — and rightly so — on the events of the Stonewall riots, our common history has made it easy to forget the struggles of our community in other parts of the country. On These Shoulders We Stand explores the early decades of the gay rights movement in Los Angeles through the eyes of a handful of heroic individuals.  Los Angeles in the 1950’s was both a gay haven and a prison. People found each other and celebrated, only to be threatened and humiliated by the police and, it seemed, the city itself. Yet with each setback, new people found their place in the movement. Fear and shame slowly transformed into defiance. Challenging authority with a knowing silence evolved into demonstrations and marches.  In the wake of Stonewall, Los Angeles hosted the first Gay Pride Parade. Feminism and the gay rights movement partnered to lead the way for women to celebrate themselves and each other. Health clinics were opened. Churches were founded. The rights of LGBT peoples were discussed and defended. One by one, victims turned into survivors. Survivors became crusaders.  This kind of place-based history reminds us that every movement is sparked by individual stories. By celebrating different communities’ contributions to our national and international LGBT rights movements, we acknowledge that each of us, no matter where we come from, has a part to play." Quoting Kristine Kolton from the 2010 Frameline 34 - SF LGBT Film Festival Site.

A vehement diatribe against pornography, the film argues that sexually explicit materials corrupt young viewers and readers, leading to acts of violence and "perverted" attitudes regarding sex—including inclination toward homosexuality.

Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in a 2003 review that it was "shrill and sometimes comical". Today, Perversion for Profit is in the public domain, and due largely to its unintentional humor value, it has become popular on the Prelinger Archives website and on YouTube. As Peter L. Stein observes in an article for the San Francisco Chronicle, however, the film also has considerable historical significance, serving as a sort of time capsule of pornography from the era as well as an example of historical concerns regarding media influence:

The turmoil of her personal and professional life is further complicated by her involvement in a love triangle.

The boss drops him through a trapdoor below the worker's desk, and replaces him with a robot that writes faster. Another worker yawns, and is also dropped through a trapdoor under his desk and replaced by a robot. Three more are eliminating for drinking water, sneezing and injury. They are replaced by more robots. The remaining worker, madly scribbling away, is shocked to discover that his boss has been replaced by a boss robot. When the latter leaves, the last worker decides to take action, and begins destroying the robots in various cartoony ways.

Documentary film	"The Yes Men are back, but no one saw them coming. After their first film, you would think they had blown their cover, but,to the contrary, they have only stepped up their game. If you don’t know them, they’re Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno, a pair of notorious troublemakers who sneak into corporate events disguised as captains of industry. Then they use their momentary authority to expose the biggest criminals on the planet. In The Yes Men Fix the World, they’ve set their sights on a plethora of manmade disasters, from profiteering after Hurricane Katrina to the environmental disaster in Bhopal.Initially their antics come across like adolescent pranks, but after further exploration, you discover that Bichlbaum and Bonanno can actually be considered “inside out activists.” By changing reality—even temporarily—they open your mind to the possible. Sweet dreams for some, a nightmare for corporate Goliaths with skeletons in the closet. When they present what should have been done, you become acutely aware of how easy it would have been to solve the problem in the first place. A film complete with comedic interludes and, yes, an underwater ballet, The Yes Men Fix the World is as entertaining as it is effective. My only fear is that by the time this film premieres at the Festival, the Yes Men could easily be in jail. See this movie now!" Quoting the description from the 2009 Sundance film Festival site.

Thriller	"A young boy from the Mumbai slums who dreams of escaping to Dubai, but who instead must deal drugs supplied by a local Maﬁa.  A new Slumdog Millionaire? Popular director Sudhir Mishra's rollercoaster-ride of a film tells of Johnny, a young boy from the Mumbai slums who dreams of escaping to Dubai, but who instead must deal drugs supplied by a local mafia don to make a living. Through this trade Johnny comes into contact with a range of diverse characters, each living out their own drama in the backstreets of the sleepless city. These include Parvez (Neil Nitin Mukesh), a young man trapped by circumstances, who is having an affair with the wife of a corrupt and dangerous cop. Then there is Preeti (Soha Ali Khan), a young model who lives with her druggy advertising boyfriend, whose life is spiralling out of control. As these and other characters' stories converge and slide inexorably into robbery, violence and murder, Johnny seizes his chance to make his dream. With mostly hand-held camerawork, and lighting not unlike Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love, this film is visually stunning."  Quoting Cary Rajinder Sawhney

Animation	The Wild Puffalumps is a 22-minute direct-to-video animated cartoon, based on the Puffalump toy line of the same name. It was produced by Nelvana, and released on videocassette in the United States by Family Home Entertainment in 1987 and in Canada by Cineplex Odeon and MCA. This cartoon was intended to act as an advertisement for the “Wild Puffalumps” toy line, which consisted of vividly-colored Puffalumps wearing Aloha shirts and sunglasses whose lenses displayed the word “WILD” when seen at the proper angle. The glasses were large enough that the children who owned the toys could wear them, a fact which was pointed out in the television commercial for the toys. In the cartoon, the characters all live on an island separate from the rest of the world, much like many other 1980s toy-based cartoon characters. The two children who visit this place soon find themselves going on a journey, parts of which are like amusement park rides, and the word “wild” is repeatedly emphasized throughout the cartoon. All of this is intended to make the characters fit in with the current cartoon culture, as well as give the impression that the toys on which they’re based are fun and exciting.

Documentary film	"Libertarian, outlaw, shaman, philosopher, romantic, preacher, genius…Bill Hicks was always something other than a comedian. His death from cancer in 1994 deprived the world of arguably the most iconic and probing voice in American culture of the period, and it's hard to find the words to do him justice. Given the fact Hicks was much more celebrated in the UK than he was at home, it is perhaps fitting that it's British filmmakers Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas who step up to pay him his dues. Cleverly shunning a conventional talking-heads approach, American: The Bill Hicks Story uses an innovative animation technique, some rare and previously unseen performance footage, and testimonies only from the people who knew him best, his family and close friends, to create a deeply perceptive, fittingly honest celebration of the man occasionally known as Goatboy. From his teenage years, when he would have to sneak out of his parents home to appear at the Austin comedy club where he first attracted attention, through to being infamously censored on The Late Show with David Letterman, this is as complete and definitive a biography as there is available. The frequent stand-up clips serve to illustrate why Hicks remains so revered and relevant: he was so funny, so fearless and always right."  Quoting Michael Hayden

Documentary film	"When Hilly Kristal opened CBGB in New York's Bowery district in 1973, he'd intended to showcase the music that those letters stood for; country, bluegrass, blues. From the time Television played their first gigs there, it was revered as the birthplace of punk, and the place from where The Ramones, Blondie, Patti Smith and Talking Heads all emerged. Described by Joey Ramone as 'the womb of creativity', it became a rock 'n' roll mecca that was mythologised unlike any other. Never mind the tales of needles in its toilets and shit on its floor, or that every joker from Spinal Tap to Vanilla Ice would play there over the years, when it closed in October 2006, it did feel that part of pop music's history had been abandoned. Mandy Stein's brilliantly realised documentary presents the history of the venue, featuring contributions from CBGB employees, punters and, of course, a number of the artists who played there, from Sting to Henry Rollins. It also relates the story of the failed campaign to keep it open, which, as it involves a feud with the non-profit homeless charity which owned the building and an attempt to move the club as a franchise to Las Vegas, is fittingly bizarre in itself. As much as anything, the film emerges as a touching tribute to Kristal, whose passion and charisma made CBGB what it was."  Quoting Michael Hayden

Comedy	A Chairy Tale is a 1957 stop-motion pixilation short film co-directed by Norman McLaren and Claude Jutra, and starring Jutra and a most uncooperative chair. The film humorously portrays Jutra's attempts to sit on the chair - and it on him - set to the music of Ravi Shankar and Chatur Lal. The film begins with a seemingly normal chair onscreen. Jutra enters, carrying a book, and attempts to sit in the chair so he can read his book. The chair unexpectedly moves out from under him. The man's persistent attempts to sit in the chair become increasingly frenetic and increasingly violent ... but only to himself, not to the chair. Finally, it dawns on the man that perhaps the chair will let him sit on it for a while if he will first allow the chair to sit on him for a few seconds. This gambit succeeds, and all ends happily. As with McLaren's equally acclaimed short Neighbours, the message of the film is that cooperation is a better means to resolve disputes than force. As with Begone Dull Care, the opening titles are presented in a few other different languages, including German, Spanish, Czech, and Italian.

Documentary film	"Hold the skepticism—the smart and funny group of people profiled in this fast-moving documentary have heard it all before. Meet Swank Ivy who makes YouTube videos debunking common beliefs about asexuals; or David Jay, the movement’s poster boy, and a regular on television talk shows. The ladies of The View can barely conceal their disbelief as young and cute Jay describes his lack of desire—for anyone. (A)sexual documents the growth of this newly organized sexual minority while raising provocative questions about queer inclusiveness and the boundaries of “normal” sexual desire.  The community is powered by the internet and modeled on the gay rights movement. In 2002 Jay created a website, asexuality.org, so he could find others like himself. Today, there are some 26,000 members of AVEN (Asexual Visibility and Education Network). Members discuss coming out as an asexual, their struggles for acceptance, and the various subgroups within the community (to cuddle or not to cuddle?). The endless parallels to queer experiences will make your head spin.  Along with David Jay and other members of the asexual community, the film features academic researchers who speculate that there are over three million asexuals in the US. Sexperts Carol Queen and Dan Savage weigh in on the fledgling asexual movement and its place in queerdom. Does the GLBTQQ community have room for another letter? And is it possible that in today’s sexualized society, lack of desire is perversion’s final frontier?" Quoting Monica Nolan from the 2011 San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival site.

Comedy	"Have you heard the one about the yodelling, country singing, lesbian twin sisters with a penchant for dressing up and comedy? Well, if you heard it you probably wouldn't believe it, but here come Jools and Lynda Topp to prove to you that reality is stranger and far more wonderful than fiction.  The Topp Twins are huge celebrities in New Zealand. Regarded as national treasures, they are firmly entrenched in the cultural landscape of their homeland with a career that spans over two decades, eight albums and the prime time TV series, Do Not Adjust Your Twinset which features such much-loved creations as Camp Mother and Camp Leader, the busty, bossy, Kiwi matron and her naïve, cardigan wearing sidekick. The Topps are also hardcore political activists who were at the forefront of campaigns for a Nuclear Free New Zeland, Maori Land Rights, a halt to the 1981 Springbok Tour and Homosexual law reform. Their commitment to progressive change coupled with their down-home, diary-farm, up-bringing reflects as much on their country as it does them. In telling the twins' story, director Pooley also deftly manages to map out a history of cultural change in New Zealand. Such is the significance of the Topp Twins that former Prime Minister Helen Clark, who was interviewed for the documentary, says of them "I think the Topps being so proudly who they were helped make (gay) issues more mainstream… That helped carry the day."  Untouchable Girls, the award-winning documentary about the Topps incredible lives, has grossed more than any other documentary at the New Zealand box office and has gained fans all over the world. Using an engaging mixture of live performance, early footage of the twins as young performers and campaigners, and interviews with their comic creations, alongside interviews with those around them, this is a warm, intelligent and truly inspiring look at two women who have engaged the hearts and minds of their country just by being their radical, fun-loving selves.

Shamsudin and Aziz Sattar as the main trio of actors. However, it is not a direct sequel to the previous "Bujang Lapok" films, as there are no references to the events of the previous films. The film is a self-referential spoof of the Malay film industry of the late 1950s/early 1960s. The plot revolves around the main trio attempting to become actors and break into the film business, and hence features a fictionalised look at the behind-the-scenes process of Malay film-making during that time. The line between reality and fiction is blurred as real film industry places are used, real film sets of previous Malay films are used for the film-within-the-film, and all the featured actors use their real-life names or derivatives thereof.

Imagine if all the people on social networks shared a common view and declared themselves a virtual country.  This is the concept behind 8TH WONDERLAND, when a group of likeminded people decide to pool their collective energy and put it to use in the real world, starting with pranks such as putting condom machines in Catholic churches, before resorting to serious political activism in order to change the world.  It is an example of international democracy that transcends borders and, like all ideals, works perfectly until someone decides to make himself leader.  Between Facebook and Danny Wallace’s HOW TO START YOUR OWN COUNTRY, 8TH WONDERLAND is not beyond the realms of possibility, and the movie not only addresses this and some serious issues, it also entertains in a multitude of languages without resorting to stereotypes.  A remarkable and genuinely entertaining film. Sign up as a citizen at www.8thwonderland.com" Quoting the program notes from the 2010 Sci-Fi-London site.

It was commissioned by the British television company Channel 4 and first broadcast in August 2012. Its release followed the publication of Holland's In the Shadow of the Sword: The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World, which also discussed the rise of the Arab Empire and the origins of Islam. Adopting the controversial theories of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted that there was little hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts.

The film's tale of a community of settlers moved to defend themselves against a roving band of marauders follows an archetypical "Western" frontier movie motif, as does Max's role as a hardened man who rediscovers his humanity when he decides to help the settlers. Filming took part in locations around Broken Hill, in the outback of New South Wales. Mad Max 2 was released on 24 December 1981, and received ample critical acclaim. Observers praised the visuals and Gibson's role. Noteworthy elements of the film also include cinematographer Dean Semler's widescreen photography of Australia's vast desert landscapes; the sparing use of dialogue throughout the film; costume designer Norma Moriceau's punk mohawked, leather bondage gear-wearing bikers; and its fast-paced, tightly edited and violent battle and chase scenes. The film's comic-book post-apocalyptic/punk style popularised the genre in film and fiction writing.

Comedy	Lonesome, middle-aged virgin Antonio Farfán is picked on and ridiculed as a matter of course, whether by coworkers or his bullying mooch of a brother (who only calls when he needs money). An employee of a notary's office, his status improves a bit when his new boss—and strangely affable doppelganger—takes an interest in him.  But Farfán's deep-seated shyness and insecurity are only partly assuaged. And when he joins a self-improvement group, he slowly confirms what the undulating lines of this sly, involving rotoscope story suggest: everything is in motion, and change is inevitable. The question becomes what use one makes of it.

Science Fiction	Beyond Witch Mountain is the second sequel to the 1975 Disney film Escape to Witch Mountain. Although Eddie Albert returned to play Jason O'Day from the original 1975 movie, the parts of Tony and Tia were recast with actors comparable only in age to Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards when they first played the parts. Tracey Gold from Growing Pains played Tia. The parts of Aristotle Bolt, Lucas Deranian and Uncle Bené were also recast. It was originally intended to be the pilot for a television series, but no networks thought that viewers would take the show seriously, and so a second episode was never made. The film also contradicts the 1978 sequel Return from Witch Mountain because in that film, Tia and Tony are of teenage years, because Uncle Bené is still alive, and because in both of the original movies, Tony had to answer Tia verbally—he did not have the power to talk through his mind. In Beyond Witch Mountain, Tia and Tony are around the same age from the first movie, Uncle Bené dies early in the film, and as previously mentioned, Tony can talk to Tia mentally.

Documentary film	"Possessing both a cosmic perspective that reaches into the vastness of time and space, and the kind of warm, earnest energy that inspires small revolutions inside human hearts, Dirt! The Movie offers an important and timely look at the vital relationship between those of us on Earth and something that is easy to take for granted—the soil upon which we tread. Inspired by William Bryant Logan’s acclaimed book Dirt, the Ecstatic Skin of the Earth, directors Bill Benenson and Gene Rosow employ a colorful combination of animation, vignettes, and personal accounts from farmers, physicists, church leaders, children, wine critics, anthropologists, and activists to learn about dirt—where it comes from, how we regard (or disregard) it, how it sustains us, the way it has become endangered, and what we can do about it. Benenson and Rosow find answers everywhere: in tiny villages that dare to rise up to battle giant corporations to trendy organic farms; from prison horticultural programs to scientists who discover connections with soil that can offset the damage from global warming. The fresh and generous spirit of Dirt! The Movie is simple and energizing. You may walk into the theatre on asphalt, carpet, and cement, but you will likely walk out with a rekindled connection to the living, dark, rich soil that lies beneath you and a mind set on cultivating a new future." Quoting the description from the 2009 Sundance Film Festival site.

Comedy	"In this eerie and fantastically shot tragicomic satire, an ordinary farmer’s morning routine is interrupted when he makes a grim discovery in the middle of his cornfield—a huge pile of dead bodies. Aghast, he reports the mysterious massacre on what happens to be Election Day. When the small-town mayor and police lieutenant take notice, fearful of unleashing a public scandal, they stall and intimidate the farmer and his family. Meanwhile, the sun beats down, and the eerie corpses remain, refusing to be ignored. As we watch with bated breath, All Your Dead Ones unspools a disquieting allegory, a silent indictment of Colombia’s ongoing civil war. The subtly heightened imagery and sound, crafted with unsettling intensity, illustrate a frightening crisis of social conscience. Tinged with mordant surrealism, director Carlos Moreno’s return to Sundance (Perro Come Perro screened at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival) demonstrates that rare ability to transcend genre and a remarkable storytelling vigor, anchored within a haunting and arresting visual motif."

Documentary film	"Hiroshima is Uruguayan director Pablo Stoll's first solo feature. Critically acclaimed for his debut film, 25 Watts, which he followed with the sublime hit Whisky (both co-directed with the late Juan Pablo Rebella), Stoll now returns to filmmaking with a completely different piece: a (mostly) silent musical.  Hiroshima is a very intimate film. The director follows his brother Juan as he goes about his daily routine in Montevideo. As the lead singer of a band, Juan lacks the ability to communicate his feelings verbally. Instead he relates to the world through his music. The natural sounds around him and the songs he listens to on his Discman take on a fundamental role in the film, and, as in the days of silent cinema, all dialogue is presented through title cards.  With the creation of a film with silent dialogue, Stoll fosters an affecting depiction of a protagonist cut off from the world around him and those close to him. The only time words are heard is when Juan watches old home movies that he found while cleaning out his closet. Unsettlingly, we are only able to hear the voices from his past and from his childhood. Similarly disconcerting is when he goes to the street market and sells the projector along with all of his family films. When the buyer asks if they are his, Juan claims to have found them and to have no idea to whom they belong. Hiroshima touches on these themes of disappearance and disengagement with great dexterity.  The film displays the talents of an emerging group of filmmakers working in Uruguay today. A number of these artists have cameos in Stoll's film: Adrián Biniez, who presents his debut, Gigante, at the Festival this year; Federico Veiroj, whose film Acné screened here last year; and Manuel Nieto Zas, director of The Dog Pound, which screened two years prior in 2006. These filmmakers gained their early experiences in cinema working on Stoll and Rebella's initial two features, and it's inspiring to see them all participating in Stoll's first independent effort. Stoll is an important name in the flourishing Uruguayan film industry, and his latest film is both a testament to his national cinema's success and a poignant tribute to the late Rebella." Quoting Diana Sanchez on the 2009 TIFF site.

Comedy	I Am So Proud Of You is a 2008 animated short film by Don Hertzfeldt. It is the second chapter of a trilogy about the character Bill and continues the dark and philosophical humor of the first film, Everything Will Be OK. In this chapter, Bill's recovery is haunted by the apparently genetic inevitability of his mental illness, and the lack of control over his own fate. The sudden death of a loved one casts a further shadow over his recovery. The short suggests "simultaneous" connections throughout time, through his strange family history, his childhood, the present, and his old age. The theme of lacking control in life and death is underscored by the subtle use of the elements of nature in many of the story's anecdotes: the ocean swallows his half-brother, fires consume a distant relative, electrical bolts are seen in the mind of his grandmother, another relative was known to eat mud, and clouds are used to illustrate the short's sequence about time. The film won 27 film festival awards, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay at the Fargo Film Festival and the Golden Starfish Award at the Hamptons International Film Festival.

Documentary film	"Werner Schroeter was one of the most significant proponents of New German Cinema. Schroeter was diagnosed with cancer in 2006. At the time, he was working for the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf gallery on a musical piece entitled ‘Schönheit der Schatten’ (The Beauty of Shadows) based on the works of Robert Schumann and Heinrich Heine. For Schroeter, oscillating between hope and trepidation, it marked the beginning of a race against time. In her film, Elfi Mikesch, who photographed a number of Schroeter’s films and who collaborated closely with him to create his vision, provides us with an intimate insight into Schroeter’s artistic output during the remaining four years of his life. MONDO LUX portrays Schroeter full of creative energy and enthusiasm for the cinema, theatre and photography. We observe him at rehearsals for ‘Antigone/Elektra’; preparing the photographic exhibition ‘Autrefois & Toujours’ and working intensively on the dubbed version of his last film, DIESE NACHT, which was shot in Portugal in 2008. Copious excerpts from Schroeter’s films, ranging from EIKA KATAPPA (1969) to DIESE NACHT (2009), reflect the colourful spectrum of his oeuvre, inscribed in a retrospective view that is pervaded by music. The film also illuminates biographical connections and enshrines the passionate bond that Schroeter felt towards film, opera and theatre, but also towards his friends, the people with whom he lived and worked. Schroeter was an artist propelled by Eros and by passion, a man who felt the proximity of both beauty and death. MONDO LUX constitutes an intimate space – a space in which, in view of the time the protagonist has left to live, every day becomes quite unlike any other. Werner Schroeter died on 12 April, 2010." Quoting the description from the 2011 Berlin International Film Festival site.

Documentary film	The summer of 1960 was a critical moment in the history of film, when the fly-on-the-wall documentary was born. The Camera that Changed the World tells the story of the filmmakers and ingenious engineers who led this revolution by building the first hand-held cameras that followed real life as it happened. By amazing co-incidence, there were two separate groups of them - one on each side of the Atlantic.  In the US, the pioneers used their new camera to make Primary, a compelling portrait of American politics. They followed a then little known John F Kennedy as he began his long campaign for the presidency. Meanwhile, in France, another new camera was inspiring an influential experiment in documentary filmmaking. Chronique d'un Ete captures the real lives of ordinary Parisians across the summer of 1960. Both these extraordinary films smashed existing conventions as handheld cameras followed the action across public spheres into intimate and previously hidden worlds.  In The Camera that Changed the World this remarkable story is told by the pioneers themselves, some of whom, such as DA Pennebaker and Al Maysles are now filmmaking legends. Back in 1960, they were determined young revolutionaries.

The film opens with a shot of the Jefferson Memorial and a voice over of Jefferson declaring his opposition to all forms of tyranny, then slowly fades to footage of Adolf Hitler making a speech soon dubbed into English "We have the right to do anything which benefits the German race, including complete expulsion of inferior peoples." The camera then moves to the crowds of people shouting Sieg heil and the soundtrack continues over pictures of war crimes. The narrator describes how the various classes of war criminals, traitors, and people who committed specific acts are dealt with, then moves on to the major Nazi war criminals. The narrator states that we cannot torture or poison them like they did to their victims, but must uphold a higher standard of justice, exemplified by George Washington. The film states that 1945 must be the year of not only Germany's military defeat but also that of a trial and therefore a public exposure and repudiation of the ideas of Nazism itself.

Documentary film	"Theory collides with comedy in HOOTERS, a behind-the-scenes documentary of The Owls, itself a film that colors outside of the genre lines. For The Owls, a collective very loosely bound by sexuality and ideas of gender takes on a project to make a seminal lesbian film in three weeks.  The cast of The Owls is a who’s who of queer film: landmark director Cheryl Dunye (The Watermelon Woman and Stranger Inside), Lisa Gornick (Tick Tock Lullaby), Guinivere Turner and VS Brodie (Go Fish), Deak Evangenikos (Itty Bitty Titty Committee), Skyler Cooper (Elena Undone), and writer Sarah Schulman. Funny interpersonal conflict never looked so good.  HOOTERS director Albelo’s alias la Chocha sneaks around behind the scenes on the set of The Owls. She tracks down members of the filmmaking collective in order to get the real scoop. And boy, does she get some. As the group works hard to finish the film, film theory collides with the collective’s vision, gender theory of different generations collides with each other and the ideal collective process collides with the reality of strong (and sometimes volatile) personalities.  HOOTERS is a quirky film that demystifies the collective filmmaking process. As anyone who has been in a collective knows, creating a truly collaborative project is often a twisting road. But with aplomb, HOOTERS shows that a daunting task can bring people together, change minds and create extremely compelling art." Quoting the synopsis from the 2010 Framelline 34 - SF LGBT Film Festival site.

Comedy	"French cinema has never been shy about depicting female desire. Cliente, Josiane Balasko’s matter-of-fact comedy about the commodification of love, is no exception.An elegant entrepreneur in her fifties, Judith unapologetically engages male escorts to minister to her sexual pleasure. When she answers Patrick’s ad, she’s charmed by the sensitive fellow in the classic suit; it’s as if he stepped right out of the Nouvelle Vague films of her youth. But from the get-go, things with this good-natured gent aren’t as efficient as with other lovers. Not only is he unable to sustain an erection on their second date, but power dynamics and his private life begin to muddy their arrangement.At home in the Paris projects, Patrick is buckling under pressure to support a gaggle of demanding relatives, including his adorable wife, Fanny, who's getting wise to his secret financial scheme. And just as you think they’ll be propelled onto predictable paths befitting characters in a less-playful, less-astute story, Judith, Patrick, and Fanny veer into murky emotional terrain, reluctantly getting tangled in a bittersweet triangle.Part bedroom farce, class melodrama, and feminist foray, Cliente is elevated by the superb performances of Eric Caravaca and Nathalie Baye. It boldly illuminates the challenge of contemporary women to define satisfaction on their own terms—somewhere between autonomy and interdependence."

McLaglen and adapted by Jack Davies from his novel Esther, Ruth and Jennifer. This film was a vehicle for both Moore and Perkins to try to escape typecasting. Previously Moore had been practically typecast as a womanising, happy-go-lucky playboy in such series as The Saint, The Persuaders! and James Bond. In contrast to those parts, he is shown here as a bearded, eccentric, arrogant cat-loving, misogynist showing heroic qualities as a master strategist. Moore once said in an interview that he preferred this film to all the James Bond movies he had starred in while acknowledging that he had been miscast in the lead role.

Science Fiction	TAMALA2010 a punk cat in space is a Japanese anime feature film. Direction, screenplay and music is attributed to the 2-person team t.o.L, known individually as K. and kuno. The film is computer animated in both 2D and 3D, and is mostly black and white. The characters, designed by t.o.L and Kentarō Konpon, are reminiscent of Sanrio's Hello Kitty and 1960's anime and manga such as Astro Boy. TAMALA2010 was originally envisioned as the first episode of a trilogy – the latter two parts were given the working titles TAMALA IN ORION and TATLA. A colour TV series was also planned, with the working title TAMALA IN SPACE. As of December 2007, none of these has surfaced – instead there have been two shorter works, the t.o.L written and directed TAMALA ON PARADE and TAMALA'S "WILD PARTY" – three short stories from different writers, storyboarded and directed by Shūichi Kohara and animated by Studio 4°C. Both of these are included on the TAMALA ON PARADE DVD, released in Japan in August 2007. This DVD does not have English subtitles.
Documentary film	GhettoPhysics: Will the Real Pimps and Hos Please Stand Up! is a 2010 docudrama film written and directed by William Arntz and E. Raymond Brown. The film is based on Brown's 2003 book, Will The Real Pimps and Hos Please Stand Up! — Peeping the Multi-leveled Global Game. The book and the film examine the interplay between Pimps and "Hos" and how that dynamic is the oldest and simplest expression of the ways in which power is wielded in today's world. The film uses documentary footage, animation, satire and dramatization to illustrate examples culled from the "hood" to Wall Street. Whether the players are real-life pimps or corporate executives, they are all playing the “game” and repeating the same power dynamics. There have historically been many negative associations with the provocative language and images surrounding the sexual politics of the Pimp/Ho dynamic. GhettoPhysics looks closely at this reality, then goes beyond the world of prostitution to illustrate and clarify how the game is played. Weaving together theories of metaphysics and archetypal psychology, the film explains how the GhettoPhysics game crosses all races, all classes and all socio-economic levels.

The film also serves to combat critics to The Silent Scream who argue that, although Nathanson claimed the film relied only on imagery and not pejorative speech, the film was heavily reliant on upon the language of the narrator.

Once known as the “California Riviera”, the Salton Sea is now called one of America’s worst ecological disasters: a fetid, stagnant, salty lake, that coughs up dead fish and birds by the thousands in frequent die-offs that occur. However, amongst the ruins of this man-made mistake, a few remaining eccentrics struggle to keep a remodeled version of the original Salton Sea dream alive. The film shares these people's stories and their difficulties in keeping their unique community alive, as the nearby cities of Los Angeles and San Diego attempt to take the agricultural water run-off that barely sustains the Salton Sea. The film ultimately explores the historical, economic, political, and environmental issues that face the Salton Sea, while taking a closer look at the people who have chosen to live in what they see as a surreal paradise.

Documentary film	"Raed Andoni has a tension headache—one that has lasted generations and isn't going to end soon. That's because Andoni is a Palestinian, living in the Ramallah, where the prospects for a stress-free life are elusive. Fix ME, Andoni's latest documentary, follows him through 20 therapy sessions as he tries to cure his unwelcome condition. The internal terrain of displacement and alienation that is revealed to his therapist and through his daily encounters with friends and family mimics the lived reality of thousands of Palestinians who are themselves displaced from their history and homeland.  Ironic in tone, stylishly shot, and with a haunting score, Fix ME deftly plays with the concept of detachment from every angle. In Andoni’s hands, life under occupation is rendered with sly humor and an unexpectedly light touch that culminates in a poignant statement about the universal longing for a way back home." Quoting the description from the 201 Sundance Film Festivals site.

Frenzy was the third film Hitchcock made in Britain after he moved to Hollywood in 1939. The other two were Under Capricorn in 1949 and Stage Fright in 1950.

Animation	Per chi lo conosce, il maestro Go Nagai non ha bisogno di presentazioni. Per chi invece non lo conosce, sono sicuro che titoli come Mazinga, Devilman, Jeeg robot d'acciaio, Ken Falco, Getter Robot, Cutie Honey, Gaiking, Full Metal Lady, Kekko Kamen e decine d'altri, diranno sicuramente qualcosa. Go Nagai, come si può capire, è stato infatti uno fra i più importanti autori del panorama manga ed anime sin dagli anni '60 e '70, quando con Scuola senza pudore e Mazinga Z introdusse in questi mezzi espressivi rispettivamente l'uso dell'erotismo e il concetto di mecha, robot giganti pilotati da uomini al loro interno. Concentrandoci sulla prima delle due innovazioni appena citate, fra i lavori minori di Nagai c'è Kamasutra, realizzato nel 1990 suddiviso in quattro tankobon, dal quale il regista Masayuki Ozeki ("Lupin III - La cospirazione dei Fuma") e lo sconosciuto esordiente Chihata Miyazaki hanno tratto un OAV intitolato Kamasutra - The ultimate sex adventure, nel resto del mondo poi esportato col titolo "Kama sutra". Questo film fa parte del genere hentai, quindi è ovviamente vietato ai minori di 18. La trama, nonostante differisca nei particolari da quella del manga, va a grandi linee a parare sugli stessi elementi del lavoro di Nagai: sesso, amore, lotta del bene contro il male ed un tocco d'esotismo con l'ambientazione indiana. Nell'anime, come nel manga, il protagonista è il giovane Yukari Tsuji (in italiano diventato Ryu), che si trova contemporaneamente a scoprire l'arte del Kama sutra e a dover salvare una principessa indiana risvegliatasi dal suo sonno d'ibernazione dopo 1500 anni. Sarò io che di 'sto genere di anime ne capisco poco il senso, ma sicuramente devo dire di preferire i film delle saghe robotiche di Nagai rispetto a queste pellicole dal tocco erotico. La storia poteva sicuramente essere realizzata con molti difetti in meno, ma più che altro essa pare un pretesto per inscenare un paio di sequenze osé dalle cui atmosfere dipende anche tutto il resto della narrazione. In "Kama sutra" quindi ogni cosa, anche la più improbabile, gravita scarsamente intorno al sesso e fra battute tipo «Ma Ryu, che sta succedendo al tuo pisello?» e scene in cui il risveglio della principessa è messo in atto facendogli bere un mix di fluido spermatico e secrezione vaginale (bleah!), il film decisamente rimane non degno di nota. Che poi effettivamente, nonostante la tremenda banalità, la parte avventurosa della storia poteva anche essere quasi passabile (di tanto in tanto si tenta anche qualche guizzo ironico), ma il film si concentra davvero troppo sugli inserimenti erotici e fa fallire il tutto. Poi pure stilisticamente il film non è un granché: pur essendo del 1991, graficamente "Kama sutra" regredisce di 10 o 20 anni, sembrando un anime degli anni '70. Anche le musiche sono mediocri, anzi proprio terribili. Cosa che anche a cercare free midi songs su Google si troverebbe di meglio.
Documentary film	Hell and Back Again is a 2010 documentary film directed by Danfung Dennis.  "In 2009, U.S. Marines launched a major helicopter assault on a Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan. Immediately upon landing, the marines were surrounded by insurgents and attacked from all sides. Embedded in Echo Company, filmmaker Danfung Dennis captures the action with visceral immediacy. As he reveals the devastating impact a Taliban machine-gun bullet has on the life of 25-year-old Sergeant Nathan Harris, Dennis’s film evolves from being a war exposé to becoming a story of one man’s personal apocalypse. From the bloody battlefields of Afghanistan, to his home in North Carolina, Harris struggles to conquer the physical and mental fallout of war. A shell of the man he once was, will Harris ever return to the happy life he shared with his loving wife, Ashley? Contrasting the horrors of the battlefield with the battle back home, Hell and Back Again is a transcendent film that comes full circle as it lays bare the true cost of war." Quoting the description from the 2011 Sundance Film Festival site.

Documentary film	The programme explores how those in power in post-war America used Freud's ideas about the unconscious mind to try and control the masses. Politicians and planners came to believe Freud's underlying premise - that deep within all human beings were dangerous and irrational desires and fears. They were convinced that it was the unleashing of these instincts that had led to the barbarism of Nazi Germany. To stop it ever happening again they set out to find ways to control this hidden enemy within the human mind. Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna, and his nephew, Edward Bernays, provided the centrepiece philosophy. The US government, big business, and the CIA used their ideas to develop techniques to manage and control the minds of the American people. But this was not a cynical exercise in manipulation. Those in power believed that the only way to make democracy work and create a stable society was to repress the savage barbarism that lurked just under the surface of normal American life.

As to be expected, the musical arrangements are particularly fine, with some near-perfect Nelson Riddle charts for the Rodgers and Hart standards "The Lady is a Tramp", "I Didn't Know What Time It Was," "I Could Write a Book" and "There's A Small Hotel." When the picture was released in 1957, Rita Hayworth surprisingly received top billing over Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was, by that time, a bigger star, and his title role was predominant.

The host is an extremely talented Bollywood chef Basu Chatterjee and he makes the best dishes in Bollywood and this is almost like eating a really good three course gourmet meal and the ingredients are extremely talented and spicy too, and there are enough gags here for a comic series.

Anymore revelations will spoil the broth as there are too many good cooks here to intrigue even people who are not too hungry for stylish sophisticated comedies which Basuda made in his later days. The movie does suffer from a lack of great soundtrack which is at best [by R. D BURMAN] only above average, compared to other Basuda movies but there are some good songs like jab ki koi kangna bole and the song sung by great dada moni in his own voice [Kishore Kumar was his younger brother] but the background score makes up for it and the cinematography is really good for an eighties movie, watch the swimming pool scene with Rati in a bikini and Mithunda in Speedos and then lets talk about who is sexy in todays generation of star kids.Anyway Basuda made Baton Baton me and also Khatta Meetha which are equally good as comedies as were his friends, Hrishidas golmaal, Naram Garam and gulzars Angoor but Shaukeen is special as it combines the talents of five comic geniuses from Bengal and showcases them in a unique way to an ultimately hilarious ending. This is not slapstick but great humorous cinema to be enjoyed again and again and if you are feeling morose take some laughter pills and I recommend this for now as every gourmet meal finishes off with a dessert or two and this dessert is actually five in numbers and four in stars.The movie is perfectly cast as the three old men headed by Ashok Kumar have a flair for comedy that is divine but Mithun is superb and his versatility as an actor here is unquestionable as he is equally good compared to the 3 giants and Rati looks an eyeful in her sexy attires without any cleavage displays and reveals a flare again for comic talent seen later in Juhi Chawala and Madhuri Dixit and before in Hema and Sridevi. But it belongs to Basuda, Dadamoni and Mithunda and thats how I justify my title. Hope you agree .let me know your opinions?I thoroughly enjoyed this feistyparty and was there for three hours or more and so did my family who accompanied me as it had a wonderfully apt environment unlike the sordid comedies of today as this is a suave sex comedy which even Hollywood would envy any day. Let me say its inspired from Basudas own Chotisi Baat which was adapted from A SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS, and also has shades of the hilarious Victoria no 203 again with the immaculate actor Ashok Kumar who along with the helpless youth Mithun steal this cake and eat it too, much to the...
Documentary film	The Mission of Raoul Wallenberg is a 1990 film directed by Alexander Rodrijanski.
Animation	After returning home from what was supposed to be a Danish-immersion camp, Larry the Cucumber meets up with Bob the Tomato for a series of sketches dealing with self-esteem, along with a Silly Song segment. In the first, "The Strange Case of Dr. Jiggle and Mr. Sly," Scooter the Carrot and Larry investigate the appearances of a flashy, disco-dancing gourd in the dark streets of London. Then Larry and a female friend team up for the Silly Song "Sport Utility Vehicle," which pokes fun at preppy SUV owners who dream of using their rugged vehicles for more than just trips to the donut shop. After the song, the title segment follows (in Dr. Seuss-style rhyming verse) the morality tale of a winged creature called a Snoodle, who learns his true self-worth during a mountaintop journey. As a special bonus, the similarly-Seussian "The Story of Flibber-o-loo," from _VeggieTales: Are You My Neighbor (1999) (V)_ , ends the video

Comedy	Shampoo is a 1975 American satirical romantic comedy-drama film written by Robert Towne and directed by Hal Ashby. It stars Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn, with Lee Grant, Jack Warden, Tony Bill and in an early film appearance, Carrie Fisher. The film is set on Election Day 1968, the day Richard Nixon was first elected as President of the United States, and was released soon after the Watergate scandal had reached its conclusion. The political atmosphere provides a source of dramatic irony, since the audience, but not the characters, are aware of the direction the Nixon presidency would eventually take. However, the main theme of the film is not presidential politics but sexual politics; it is renowned for its sharp satire of late-1960s sexual and social mores. The lead character, George Roundy, is reportedly based on several actual hairdressers, including Jay Sebring and film producer Jon Peters, who is a former hairdresser. Sebring was brutally murdered by the Charles Manson family in 1969. According to the 2010 book Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America by Peter Biskind, the screenwriter Towne based the character on Beverly Hills hairdresser Gene Shacove.

Belvaux referred in the DVD commentary that main idea behind Trilogy is that the main characters in a particular story are the secondary characters of others, in such sense the three films happen at the same time and share a series of common scenes and plot points, complementing each other, but also have their own perspective and style. The audience is left with piecing the films together, which Belvaux avoided, since editing the three films into one single narrative would have resulted in a very long film with no style of its own.

The producers were careful to cut mentions in the film of British traitors during the Second World War, such as John Amery and Norman Baillie-Stewart, out of fear of litigation by their families.

Comedy	Silent Movie is a 1976 satirical comedy film co-written, directed by, and starring Mel Brooks, and released by 20th Century Fox on June 17, 1976. The ensemble cast includes Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Bernadette Peters, and Sid Caesar, with appearances by Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Marcel Marceau and Paul Newman playing themselves. While indeed silent, the film is a parody of the silent film genre, particularly the slapstick comedies of Charlie Chaplin, Mack Sennett, and Buster Keaton. Among the film's most famous gags is the fact that the only audible word in the movie is spoken by Marcel Marceau, a noted mime. Sound is a big factor in the film's humor, as when a scene that shows New York City begins with the song "San Francisco", only to have it come to a sudden stop as if the musicians realize they are playing the wrong music. They then go into "I'll Take Manhattan" instead. A play on the 1970s trend of large corporations buying up smaller companies is parodied in this film by the attempt of the Engulf and Devour Corporation to take control of a studio.

Documentary film	THE LAST SURVIVOR is a character-based, feature-length documentary film that presents the stories of genocide Survivors and their struggle to make sense of tragedy by working to educate, motivate and foster a civic response to these horrific acts. Following the lives of survivors of four different genocides and mass atrocities -- The Holocaust, Rwanda, Darfur, and Congo -- THE LAST SURVIVOR presents a unique opportunity to learn from the lessons and mistakes of our past in order to have a lasting social impact on how we act collectively in the face of similar issues today.In choosing four survivors who work as activists in the anti-genocide movement, the film promotes the vital importance of Survivor advocacy -- the need for genocide Survivors to become leaders in a movement that seeks to remind the world what happens when apathy and inaction prevail. By presenting these stories of loss, survival, and hope side by side, the film highlights the commonalities these individuals share both as Survivors and, more broadly, as human beings.Having shot on location in five countries across four continents, the film focuses on the universality of the horror of genocide -- combating the misguided notion that genocide is something that happens "over there." Rather, the film asks its audience to consider genocide as an evil that has occurred on nearly every single continent and one that affects all of us as human beings. In the end, THE LAST SURVIVOR is above all else an intimate meditation on how one begins to pick up the pieces of a broken life after experiencing such tragedy.To learn more about how you can help survivors and prevent genocide, visit www.TheLastSurvivor.com

Comedy	"What happens when a man falls out of love with his wife? In Oskar's case, he turns on the bedside lamp and suddenly realizes how big her nose looks against the bedroom wall! In this single shot, a masterly stroke so simple and yet so scaldingly ironic, Czech director Jan Hrebejk accomplishes the impossible. He tells the story of an unhappy marriage, complete with imminent demise, in one image: the husband reduced to a detached observer, his spouse a literal shadow of her former self, and their future up against the wall. “I like to explore national embarrassments,” Hrebejk once said in an interview with Time magazine, and it seems he meant it.  Oskar (Jirí Machácek), a popular TV weather forecaster, suddenly wakes up to an altered sense of identity: rather than belonging to easygoing wife Zuzana (a bewildered Simona Babcáková), he feels he ought to belong to the whole wide world – hence the national embarrassment. His first entanglement is with babysitter Kocicka (Eva Kerekéšová), a lean teenybopper who's more attached to her pet turtle than her older lover – at least until he accidentally smothers it in the dryer. Next in line is mature pop icon Nora (Emília Vašáryová), who's about to teach him a thing or two about freedom: the more people you let in, the more alone you end up feeling.  Throughout Oskar's mid-life flight from self-awareness, Hrebejk employs an unusually lighthearted palette, cleverly channelling all the joie de vivre that's missing from his characters' lives. The art direction grows increasingly symmetrical as Oskar's fate spirals further out of control. While Zuzana takes uncertain steps toward a new-found happiness, Oskar's promiscuity opens the door to all kinds of loneliness. By the time he ends up in the bathtub with one of his former students (he used to be a teacher), he's too numb to even notice. But that doesn't stop him from going public with his love life on his ex-wife's radio show before he's even had time to dry. Shameless, yes? No, just another one of Hrebejk's national embarrassments!" Quoting Dimitri Eipides from the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival site.

Documentary film	"Piecing together the various narratives of Philip Hoffman's brilliant All Fall Down, his first feature-length work after innumerable magnificent shorts, is one of the most invigorating and rewarding pleasures you're likely to have in a cinema this year. Merging a personal essay with a regional history, All Fall Down is constructed from artifacts, beginning obliquely with scratched, black-and-white aerial footage of southern Ontario and an agitated man describing the deterioration of his health on the soundtrack.  The voice belongs to writer George Lachlan Brown, whose life took an unforeseen and tragic course when he was in his thirties. Seen only in home-movie footage and heard on countless phone messages that grow increasingly aggravated and anxious, Brown resorts to living in shelters (he has health, economic and immigration problems) after losing his car. An outsider desperate for any attention and unable to deal with the situation in which he finds himself, Brown struggles to find equilibrium while his imagination turns to wild conspiracy theories. Developing alongside this tale is an investigation of a genuine regional historical figure, who we discover to be hardly what she seems. These two storylines are juxtaposed with Hoffman's serio-comic use of footage from a historical docudrama that he made but was never properly paid for. (A running tally counts the value of the footage until Hoffman uses enough to balance the fee he expected for the project.)  All Fall Down smartly references Wallace Stevens's classic modernist poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” which analyzes how different perspectives can seem utterly irreconcilable yet completely logical depending on the context. As Brown's entreaties to his unnamed former wife grow more disconnected and outrageous, we start questioning how much we actually know about people – and what constitutes a personality. Is the real George Lachlan Brown the person we hear on the voicemails, the father playing with his daughter in the home movies or someone else entirely? Hoffman's own links to Brown are intimate and complex.  What emerges is a film that is at once mysterious, visually and aurally stunning, heart-rending and intellectually rigorous." Quoting Steve Gravestock on the 2009 TIFF site.

Documentary film	There were two wars going on in Iraq - one was fought with armies of soldiers, bombs and a fearsome military force. The other was fought alongside it with cameras, satellites, armies of journalists and propaganda techniques. One war was rationalized as an effort to find and disarm WMDs - Weapons of Mass Destruction; the other was carried out by even more powerful WMDs, Weapons of Mass Deception.The TV networks in America considered their non-stop coverage their finest hour, pointing to the use of embedded journalists and new technologies that permitted viewers to see a war up close for the first time. But different countries saw different wars. Why?For those of us watching the coverage, war was more of a spectacle, an around the clock global media marathon, pitting media outlets against each other in ways that distorted truth and raised as many questions about the methods of TV news, as it did the armed intervention it was covering-and it some cases-promoting.WMD busts through so-called "objective reporting" to challenge media complicity with the government and its cooperation in presenting the Iraq War the way it did. This is a hard-hitting, yet personal film that looks at the television war and asks why the American audience lapped it up and how the Pentagon helped shape media coverage.

Documentary film	The Player is a 2009 documentary film written and directed by John Appel.  "As this film makes clear, its director John Appel has a deeply rooted interest in gambling. His father was an ardent horserace player, which caused problems in the family to say the least. Shortly before he died, Appel's father wrote him a letter while he was still at school. This letter serves as Appel's point of departure for an investigation into the causes of his father's destructive gambling mania, which he blends in the film with the stories of several other men, alter egos of his father. Interestingly, it is almost exclusively men who suffer from this dependence on gambling. Using family photos and films, Appel relates anecdotes to characterize his father and shed light on the events that led to his downfall. In between, we visit the horse races, where we meet an extremely good-humored bookie named Harry. Another Harry is a compulsive liar and gambling addict who is in jail for the umpteenth time. Even there, he cannot resist being deceptive. And we see a poker player who makes his tragic way from a Spartan hotel room to the casino each day. In Appel's psychological portrait of his father, it gradually emerges just what drives the gamblers and why their addiction is so difficult to put a stop to." Quoting the description form the 2009 iDFA site.

Documentary film	"Glenn Gould is arguably the most documented classical musician of the last century. In addition to numerous films about him (including François Girard's seminal Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould and two fine portraits by Roman Kroitor), Gould appeared in countless radio and television programmes, culminating with John McGreevy's legendary Glenn Gould's Toronto.  Still, few of these pieces have managed to truly capture all of the myriad contradictions that made up Gould. Most have readily accepted his carefully groomed public persona. One of the more notable aspects of Michèle Hozer and Peter Raymont's Genius Within: The Inner Life of Glenn Gould is how it explores the incongruities between Gould's private reality and his wider image. It investigates Gould's personal life, specifically his long-running affair with painter Cornelia Foss, his drug intake and how his public facade began to take over his existence.  Genius Within is packed with compelling interviews with key people in Gould's life, including childhood friends, collaborators and even pop singer Petula Clark (a semi-ironic obsession for Gould). Hozer and Raymont have unearthed some truly extraordinary unseen footage, like the short film Gould made with writer and photographer Jock Carroll in the Caribbean.  The documentary is a fascinating record of a key moment in our cultural history – that post-war period in the fifties and sixties when you could actually begin to discuss Canadian culture as a distinct entity. But what ultimately emerges is a man imprisoned by his own eccentricities and an image that came to dominate his life. In many ways, the film is a portrait of loneliness and isolation, which some saw as Gould's overriding themes in his radio work and writing. Genius Within is an assured, comprehensive and balanced portrait of one of Canada's most significant cultural icons." Quoting Steve Gravestock on the 2009 TiFF site.

Animation	Trac! is a 2012 short film directed by Flavio Del Carlo.
Thriller	"Few directors have addressed the issues of the past decade as courageously as Denmark’s Susanne Bier. With the much celebrated Brothers, she raised troubling questions about the First World’s relationship with the Third. After the Wedding pursued this subject further, contrasting the conflicting demands of the domestic and the societal. Her latest, In a Better World, explores similar terrain while offering a devastating critique of masculinity.   In a war-torn African nation, physician Anton (Everlasting Moments’s Mikael Persbrandt) confronts a steady stream of tragedy and loss. Much of what he faces can be traced back to a vicious and sadistic local warlord. Back home in Denmark, his estranged wife, Marianne (Trine Dyrholm), is concerned about their eldest son, Elias, who is picked on mercilessly by the class bully, Sofus.  When new kid Christian arrives in class, he and Elias bond over a mutual hatred of Sofus. Surly and vicious since the loss of his mother, Christian is hardening into a rigid and ferocious manifestation of masculinity. His heartbroken father, Claus (Ulrich Thomsen), is finding it impossible to cope with Christian’s behaviour. The volatile situation is exacerbated by Anton’s return home and by an encounter between Anton, Elias, Christian and a violent, bullying mechanic (Pusher’s Kim Bodnia).  At the heart of the film is the issue of male responsibility, specifically what it means to stand up for yourself and others. Troubled and confused by what he faced in Africa, Anton has no credible response to Christian’s demand that he answer the mechanic’s abusive behaviour in kind. The painful, dangerous rift between Christian and Claus, and the growing distance between Elias and his distracted parents, only makes the situation worse. Left alone to solve their problems, Elias and Christian grow even closer. As their clandestine acts of vengeance become more drastic, the film builds to an almost unbearable intensity. Far more than a mere exercise in suspense, the film raises essential questions about a world that has grown increasingly complex." Quoting Steve Gravestock from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.

When her father falls seriously ill in her hometown, her boyfriend Kenichi, who relies on her as a substitute mother for his little daughter Kayako, decides that the three of them should move to the country and take over the father's clam business. But in her hometown Sawako has a reputation as an ungrateful daughter who ran away from home. So she and her patchwork family are not exactly welcomed with open arms.  The film portrays this reencounter as a twist of fate in which issues of social background and gender roles come into play in some genuinely funny situations. The gentle Sawako doesn't seem to stand a chance against the gossip and this rough and crude environment, with its verbal abuse and heavy beer consumption. But is it really impossible to get the better of one's social class and conditioning? Sawako sees her opportunity and seizes it. The only loser is he who allows himself to be turned into one. But here the fragile bloom of hope in the end turns into a gigantic melon." Quoting the description from the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival site.

Documentary film	"The film bears witness to German artist Anselm Kiefer’s alchemical creative processes and renders as a film journey the personal universe he has built at his hill studio estate in the South of France. In 1993 Kiefer left Buchan, Germany for La Ribotte, a derelict silk factory near Barjac. From 2000 he began constructing a series of elaborate installations there, comprising 48 buildings, a labyrinth of tunnels, bridges, lakes and towers. Traversing this landscape, the film immerses the audience in the total world and creative process of one of today’s most significant artists. Shot in cinemascope, the film constructs visual set pieces alongside observational footage to capture both the dramatic resonance of Kiefer’s art and the intimate process of creation. This polarity - in terms of scale, sensibility and time - animates the film, creating a multi-layered narrative through which to navigate the complex spaces of La Ribotte. Here creation and destruction are interdependent; the film enters into direct contact with the raw materials Kiefer employs to build his paintings and sculptures - lead, concrete, ash, acid, earth, glass and gold..." Quoting the synopsis from the 2010 Cannes Film Festival site.

Documentary film	Mingus: Charlie Mingus 1968 is a 1968 American documentary film directed by Thomas Reichman that follows the later life of jazz musician Charles Mingus and his five year-old daughter in 1966, as they are being evicted from his New York apartment for not paying the rent. Reichman talks with Mingus in a very personal setting as the film documents Mingus' outlook on society, women, music, his daughter, politics, and the country as a whole. The camera crew talks with Mingus conversationally and spends time with him and his daughter so that the film takes on an intimate air. The film highlights their way of life and how political and racial tensions affected people of the 1960s personally. The reason for Reichman’s investigation into Mingus’ eviction was to show the lifestyle of a prominent jazz musician and to show how American society was structured during the Civil Rights era. At a time when the Jim Crow laws had recently been rescinded, there were African Americans who didn't feel they were treated equally; in many cases they weren't.

An older, less advanced Terminator is also sent back in time to protect John. After a troubled pre-production characterized by legal disputes, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures emerged with the franchise's property rights in early 1990. This paved the way for the completion of the screenplay by a Cameron-led production team, and the October 1990 start of a shortened 186-day filming schedule. The production of Terminator 2 required an unprecedented budget of more than $94 million, much of which was spent on filming and special effects.

Documentary film	Page One: A Year Inside the New York Times is a 2011 documentary film written by Kate Novack and  Andrew Rossi directed by Andrew Rossi.  "With the Internet surpassing print as our main news source, newspapers going bankrupt, and outlets focusing on content they claim audiences (or is it advertisers?) want, Page One chronicles the media industry’s transformation and assesses the high stakes for democracy if in-depth investigative reporting becomes extinct.  The film deftly makes a beeline for the eye of the storm or, depending on how you look at it, the inner sanctum of the media, gaining unprecedented access to the New York Times newsroom for a year. At the media desk, a dialectical play-within-a-play transpires as writers like salty David Carr track print journalism’s metamorphosis even as their own paper struggles to stay vital and solvent. Meanwhile, rigorous journalism—including vibrant cross-cubicle debate and collaboration, tenacious jockeying for on-record quotes, and skillful page-one pitching—is alive and well. The resources, intellectual capital, stamina, and self-awareness mobilized when it counts attest there are no shortcuts when analyzing and reporting complex truths." Quoting the description from the 2011 Sundance Film Festival site.

Comedy	Damn Yankees is a 1958 musical film made by Warner Bros., a modern version of the Faust story involving the New York Yankees and Washington Senators baseball teams. The film is based on the 1955 Broadway musical of the same name. The film version was directed by George Abbott, as was the earlier stage version, with assistance from Stanley Donen. With the exception of Tab Hunter in the role of Joe Hardy, the Broadway principals reprised their stage roles, including Gwen Verdon as Lola. A notable difference between film and stage versions was Gwen Verdon's performance of the song "A Little Brains". For the film, Verdon’s suggestive hip movements were considered too risqué for a mainstream American film in 1958, and so, in the film, she simply pauses at these points. The film was released in the United Kingdom under the title What Lola Wants, to avoid use of the word "Damn" on posters, hoardings and cinema marquees. It was also possibly because the title's pun, alluding to the American Southerner's colloquial term for Northerners would be lost on foreign audiences.

Comedy	The One is a 2011 romantic comedy film written and directed by Caytha Jentis.  This romantic comedy takes the conventions of the genre and gives it a stylishly queer twist – think Philadelphia Story meets Latter Days - or, better yet, a comedic updating of the 1982 groundbreaker Making Love.  Hunky Daniel (Jon Prescott) couldn’t have it better – great parents, a successful career as an investment banker, and the beautiful Jen (Margaret Anne Florence) as his fiancée. A seemingly perfect life... but there is one temptation that may derail his best laid plans for the straight-and-narrow: he has a thing for Tommy (Ian Novick), a charming former college classmate who is now openly gay.  After a few drinks, Daniel succumbs to his repressed desires and makes a one time "mistake." Soon after their initial tryst, the normally jaded Tommy falls head over heels in love, but Daniel wants nothing more of him or his dazzlingly seductive smile – he’s back with Jen, determined to marry her. With Tommy’s friends warning him against his involvement with a straight man and Daniel’s pledge of heterosexually, it would seem that nothing will come of them... but love and lust have a way of messing up even the best laid plans of man.  A refreshingly funny story of coming out as well as a belated coming-of-age tale that sparkles with witty dialogue and believable characters.

Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film, Crimes and Misdemeanors. It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for an English setting. Critics in the United States praised the film and its British setting, and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen. In contrast, reviewers from the United Kingdom treated Match Point less favourably, finding fault with the locations and, especially, the idiom of the dialogue. Allen was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

Comedy	Tartuffe, French playwright Moliere's 16th-century satire of religious quackery, is given right and proper treatment by the Royal Shakespeare Company in this videotaped staging. Anthony Sher plays the title role, a haughty, self-righteous phony who inveigles his way into a wealthy household. Not content with robbing his host blind in the name of the Almighty, Tartuffe also sets about to seduce the lady in the house. The satire was so pointed that, when the play was originally presented, Moliere was forced to shoehorn in a scene showing Tartuffe's punishment at the hands of the authorities--the best possible way of distancing Tartuffe's fraudulent piety with the real-life power abuses then being perpetrated by the Church. Also featured in this witty adaptation of the Moliere original is Nigel Hawthorne, who would later be nominated for an Oscar for The Madness of King George.

Science Fiction	20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a 1916 silent film directed by Stuart Paton. The film's storyline is based on the novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. It also incorporates elements from Verne's The Mysterious Island. This was the first motion picture filmed underwater. Actual underwater cameras were not used, but a system of watertight tubes and mirrors allowed the camera to shoot reflected images of underwater scenes staged in shallow sunlit waters. The film was made by The Universal Film Manufacturing Company, not then known as a major motion picture studio. Yet in 1916, they financed this film's innovative special effects, location photography, large sets, exotic costumes, sailing ships, and full-size navigable mock-up of the surfaced submarine Nautilus. Hal Erickson has said that "the cost of this film was so astronomical that it could not possibly post a profit, putting the kibosh on any subsequent Verne adaptations for the next 12 years." On May 4, 2010, a new print of the film was shown accompanied by live performance of an original score by Stephin Merritt at the Castro Theatre, as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival.

Animation	The 2000 Year Old Man is a persona in a comedy skit, originally created by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner in 1961. Mel Brooks played the oldest man in the world, interviewed by Carl Reiner in a series of comedy routines that appeared on television, as well as being made into a collection of records. In a Yiddish accent, Brooks would improvise answers to topics such as the earliest known language, the creation of the Cross, and Joan of Arc. The inspiration for the skit was a tape-recorded exchange between Brooks and Reiner at a party that took place at Brooks' beachfront house in Lonelyville, on Fire Island. The tape recorder was brought into the mix shortly after the opening salvos, as the two comics soon had the party audience in stitches. In 1961, when the duo began doing the skit on television, Brooks had just undergone surgery for gout. Because of his post-surgical discomfort, Brooks quipped, "I feel like a 2000-year-old man," which led Reiner to begin questioning him about what it's like to be a 2000-year-old man and to describe history as Brooks saw it.

Animation	Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys is a 2001 computer-animated feature film directed by Bill Kowalchuk for GoodTimes Entertainment. It was released on video and DVD on October 30, 2001. The film revisits classic characters like Hermey the Elf and Rudolph, who is now famous at the Arctic tundra, and uses the characters from the 1964 Rankin-Bass TV special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and takes place several years after the events of that special. However, technically and legally speaking, it is a sequel to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie, which Goodtimes had released in 1998. Kowalchuk directed both of the Goodtimes movies, and Kathleen Barr provided the voice of Rudolph in both films, though there is little to no character continuity between the two films, instead attempting to establish it in the Rankin-Bass fictional universe. The German cover shows Rudolph as he appeared in the 1998 film and bills it as "Rudolph 2", suggesting it to be a sequel to the 1998 film, however he is shown alongside the licensed Rankin-Bass characters in the film.

Comedy	"Timely, insightful, and downright funny, Why We Laugh: Black Comedians on Black Comedy is a sweeping account of the evolution of black comedy in America. Inspired by comedian Darryl Littleton’s book, directors Robert Townsend and Quincy Newell have crafted a no-holds-barred documentary that is both an insider’s take and a critical examination of the cultural influence of black comedy.Townsend and Newell enrich this hilarious and spectacularly archived film by including interviews with prominent scholars, politicians, cultural critics, and a host of notable comics, including Bill Cosby, Chris Rock, Keenan Ivory Wayans, and Eddie Griffin. Why We Laugh tracks the way black comedy has evolved from Stepin Fetchit and minstrels in blackface to the politically tinged humor of Dick Gregory, and from the television success of Good Times and The Jeffersons to the big-screen accomplishments of stars like Eddie Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg. Townsend and Newell turn a perceptive eye on the controversial career of Dave Chapelle and the implications of corporate efforts to capitalize on the massive successes of Russell Simmons’s Def Comedy Jam and Spike Lee’s The Original Kings of Comedy.A major historical contribution to American culture—and a hoot to watch—Why We Laugh is a tribute to the way individuals can change history, as well as a cautionary tale about how tenuous that change can be."

In the previous film, Claw's face was visible and was an upper-class business man. He appears to be older in age than he was in the original, although the story only takes place four years later.

Documentary film	"In 1880, the city of San Francisco passed a health and safety ordinance—all laundries in wooden buildings had to get the approval of the Board of Supervisors in order to obtain a license. The law, on its face, didn't single out the Chinese. But when it was applied, every Chinese laundry owner in the city was denied a permit. Every white-owned laundry was granted a permit. Yick Wo refused to shut down his business and was arrested. He fought his case from behind bars. He took it all the way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment's "equal protection" clause because of the unequal application of the law. It was the very first Supreme Court case to use this standard and it did so almost eighty years before the Court's landmark rulings striking down Jim Crow statutes enacted in the segregationist south. Yick Wo was not an American citizen—because by law he wasn't allowed to be. Yet the Court ruled that his rights were still protected by the 14th Amendment because it says that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." It does not limit that protection only to citizens." Quoting the description from the 2010 United Nations Association Film Festival site.

Documentary film	As produced by (and aired on) A's History Channel, the speculative documentary Clash of the Cavemen travels back in time tens of thousands of years to the Earth's premier Ice Age. The program theorizes that at this point in early history, two early sub-species of homo sapiens walked the Earth: the brawny and sinewy Neanderthals, who exhibited tremendous physical strength, prowess and a resistance to pain but limited mental power, and the Cro-Magnons, who, conversely, exhibited astonishing intelligence but suffered from weak and disease-prone physical constitutions. To put it more bluntly, the repeated confrontations between these two species pitted brain against brawn in a contest for survival of the fittest. As time wore on, each sub-species found its very existence threatened by such external forces as extreme temperatures, a decline in available food, and animal predators. Clash of the Cavemen revisits this era and relays the tale of the Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals, abetted by data from the genome-mapping project at the Max Planck Institute in Germany and by dramatic onscreen recreations.

Thriller	"A dilapidated, practically empty apartment in the Berlin district of ‘Mitte’. This is where Nina and two young actors named Hans and Marie have come together to leave behind the winter cold for a few days and do some screen tests for a film. Nina is a searcher; she wants her film to make feelings visible and intends to portray love by showing real sex. But the more blurred the borders between fiction and reality become, the less Nina seems inclined to make the film at all. Hans, who knows Nina from a brief encounter a long time ago, senses that she is searching for something else. Nonetheless, he and Marie both agree to go along with the play-acting. So far, each is convinced that they are pulling the strings. But Nina’s strategies of seduction weave an ever-tightening web around her protagonists. Nina’s credo that they should not play themselves or anyone else soon becomes a trap for Hans and Marie. No wonder that it becomes almost impossible to decipher where the acting ends and reality begins. The further Nina sets off down a path to an unknown destination, the more the actors shield themselves from each other and keep their feelings to themselves. Their longing for the outside world is a palpable force, but each attempt to open up to each other ends in an emotional blow below the belt. Without a script, communication becomes balancing act; coolness and distance would seem to be the only adequate means of protection. In this world, failure can only lead to a bittersweet happy ending." Quoting the program notes from the 2010 Berlin Film Festival site.

Animation	Gertie the Dinosaur is a 1914 animated short film by American cartoonist and animator Winsor McCay. It is the earliest animated film to feature a dinosaur. McCay first used the film before live audiences as an interactive part of his vaudeville act; the frisky, childlike Gertie did tricks at the command of her master. McCay's employer William Randolph Hearst later curtailed McCay's vaudeville activities, so McCay added a live-action introductory sequence to the film for its theatrical release. McCay abandoned a sequel, Gertie on Tour, after producing about a minute of footage. Although Gertie is popularly thought to be the earliest animated film, McCay had earlier made Little Nemo and How a Mosquito Operates . The American J. Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl had experimented with animation even earlier; Gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished McCay's film from these earlier "trick films". Gertie was the first film to use animation techniques such as keyframes, registration marks, tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and animation loops.

Comedy	The Castanet Club is a 1991 Australian film starring the popular Newcastle cabaret troupe, The Castanet Club.The Castanet Club started life in the gritty steel town of Newcastle, NSW, Australia, in 1982. The town was like a kind of artistic blast furnace as well. Precious metal was separated from the slag by audiences who demanded no-bull entertainment. It was a matter of either “do your business, or get off the pot”. This earthy ethos which dominated the Second City of NSW also produced such talents as Silverchair, The Screaming Jets and The Marching Koalas. Great original work often comes from the regions. Cities like Newcastle punch above their weight, because talent there has the licence to fail for a while, as it develops and grow. Audiences forgive initial failures, because frankly there’s not much else going on and, besides, they know everyone up on stage. And so it was with The Castanet Club.
