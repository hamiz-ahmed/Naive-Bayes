PG-13 (USA)	"Paparazzi might be the norm in our celebrity-infested times, haphazardly snapping every movement of the rich and famous. Ron Galella, though, is the original paparazzo. He elevated the celebrity snapshot into art and, at 78, remains a stalwart in the business. Dogged in his quest to photograph celebrities in unguarded moments, he defines his passion for his work by the ups and downs of his career—documenting the parade of stars at a thriving Studio 54 and having the dubious honor of being sued by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (his favorite subject) and having his jaw broken by Marlon Brando.  Leon Gast (When We Were Kings) masterfully profiles Galella and places him at the center of the debate about the First Amendment right to privacy. Galella’s work and tactics have their critics, but his influence is undeniable. In a career defined by perseverance, he has created some of the most lasting, iconic photographs of our times." Quoting the description from the 2010 Sundance Film festival site.

Their duel threatens to tear apart the ANC and the country, as the poor desperately seek hope in change and the elite fight for the spoils of victory.The film features key interviews with ANC current and former leaders, including Jacob Zuma, Kgalema Motlanthe, Pallo Jordan, Thabo Mbeki, and Terror Lekota. Examining previous events that the country's political decision-makers have agreed to bury for the sake of democracy, Behind the Rainbow is a behind-the-scenes look at South Africa's seemingly miraculous transformation.

R (USA)	Beginners is a 2010 film directed by Mike Mills.  "Seventy-five-year-old Hal has found love with a man half his age, and is overjoyed to be dancing to house music at the club. Oliver, his 38-year-old graphic artist son, is not so lucky. He’s the permanently brokenhearted veteran of short-lived affairs who is afraid to be happy even when he’s met the woman of his dreams. Thumbsucker director Mike Mills charms with this autobiographical tale inspired by his own father’s decision to come out late in life. Ewan McGregor is the son confused by, but supportive of, his father’s new lifestyle. Christopher Plummer, giving one of his finest performances, is a man determined to finally be true to himself and live life to the fullest, even in the wake of a cancer diagnosis. The story jumps nimbly back and forth through time as Oliver navigates a promising new relationship, recalls his parents’ passionless marriage and wonders at Hal’s later life as a bon vivant senior citizen refusing to give in to illness. Excellent supporting turns from Goran Visnjic and Inglourious Basterds’ Mélanie Laurent (as father and son’s respective love interests) and a “talking” Jack Russell terrier make up the lively ensemble. Stylish direction and Mills’ witty, intelligent script add to the film’s delights. This is a moving and layered work with lots of laughs and all the poignancy of a son’s love letter to his father." Quoting Pam Grady from the 2011 San Francisco International Film Festival site.
R (USA)	Somewhere is a 2010 American drama film written and directed by Sofia Coppola. The film follows Johnny Marco, a newly famous actor, as he recuperates from a minor injury at the Chateau Marmont, a well-known Hollywood retreat. Despite money, fame and professional success, Marco is trapped in an existential crisis and feels little emotion during his daily life. When his ex-wife suffers an unexplained breakdown and goes away, she leaves Cleo, their 11-year-old daughter, in his care. They spend time together and her presence helps Marco mature and accept adult responsibility. The film explores ennui among Hollywood stars, the father–daughter relationship and offers an oblique comedy of show business, particularly Hollywood film-making and the life of a "star". Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion award for best picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy for a handful of characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success.

G	Everyday, each American throws away an average of 4.5 pounds of garbage. But where exactly is "away"? Trashed, a 20-minute documentary, dives headlong into the world of garbage and surfaces in some unlikely places.An existential road trip through the quixotic American waste stream, Trashed asked the question, "What does our trash say about us?"For some, like veteran garbage truck driver Eddie Scott, "trash is a way of living." For others, like expert Eugene Tseng, deemed "The World's Most Over-Educated Garbage Man," trash is a mindset.Eugene has personally dug through local garbage cans to analyze their contents. His findings? Everything from non-biodegradable medical waste to 50-year-old newspapers, still intact. He reminds us that we use many products for a fraction of the time that they spend at a landfill./The film draws us into the unusual worlds of people whose lives revolve around strangers' waste.They represent the enormous invisible network that is dedicated to putting garbage as far out of sight as possible, resulting in a system that is largely taken for granted. Sam Pedroza, an environmental engineer at the largest operating US landfill, wonders whether our trash-collectors may be doing "too good of a job." obscuring questions liike, "Where will our trash go when out largest landfills run out of space in the next decade?"As the film dives deeper, however, we find that the system itself is comprised of a Byzantine network of private industries whose interests are not always aligned.

For better or worse, it will change the way you think about your garbage.

Jack and Connie are two single people who on their own might continue to recede into the anonymous background of the city, but in each other begin to find the courage and desire to pursue their budding relationship. In contrast, the couple who brought them together, Clyde and Lucy, are confronting the unresolved issues in their rocky marriage.

Set during the World War II North African Western Desert Campaign, it follows a misadventurous squad of French Foreign Legion deserters, led by their charismatic Sarge, who set out across the Sahara desert to strike a blow on the Nazi-occupied city of Tobruk.

Sarge, the anti-hero protagonist, is a patriot with an over-the-top John Wayne persona. The antagonist, General Von Kraut, is a derogatory portrayal of a Nazi commander – extremely evil, perverted and a poor decision maker – emphasized by his name, as kraut is often used as a pejorative term for German soldiers. Furthermore, Sarge's group of misfit soldiers include a Native American, a New York Jew, a hillbilly and a French officer in the style of Maurice Chevalier.

PG-13 (USA)	A Stranger Among Us is a 1992 film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Melanie Griffith. It tells the story of an undercover police officer's experiences in a Hasidic community. It was entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. It is often cited as one of Lumet's two failures of the 1990s, the other being Guilty as Sin. Despite the poor reviews suffered by both these films, Lumet received the 1993 D. W. Griffith Award of the Directors Guild of America. Some of the criticism of A Stranger Among Us is based on comparisons with the Academy Award-winning film Witness, which has a superficially similar plot. Similarly, Lumet's earlier film Fail-Safe was unfavorably compared to Dr. Strangelove, but in that case both films have subsequently achieved cult status. Griffith's performance in the lead role has also been heavily criticized, for which her role won her the Razzie Award for Worst Actress, while Tracy Pollan was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress.

PG-13 (USA)	The Baxter is a 2005 film written by, directed by and starring American comedian Michael Showalter. A “Baxter”, as defined by the film, is the nice, dull guy in a romantic comedy who is dumped at the end of the story for the protagonist.

The plot revolves around the life of Elliot Sherman during the two weeks before his wedding, as he doggedly fights off the curse of his former Baxter role in relationships.

G	Sound of Noise is a 2010 film written and directed by Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjärne Nilsson.  "The revival of the musical takes a dramatic turn as the directors and musicians from the hit-short Music for One Apartment and Six Drummers reunite in this musical thriller. Moving away from a genre re-popularized and commercialized by the High School Musical phenomenon, Sound of Noise turns up as the black sheep of the family; an instrumental indie cousin proving there is clearly a choice to be made. Putting the concept of a stomp-like performance in a dramatic context, the group of musical activists shows up in various spots in a city, creating a rhythmic mayhem that attracts the attention of a tone-deaf police officer.  The anarchic theme, fuelled by a punkish energy, can be seen as a protest against a cultural political climate increasingly influenced by corporate organizations and drawn towards entertainment.  Moreover, the film explores the boundaries between music and noise; the avant-garde composer John Cage has been an influence on directors Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjärne Nilsson." Quoting the description from the 2010 Warsaw International Film Festival site.

The story revolves around a duo of incredibly untalented American lounge singers who travel to a booking in Morocco and stumble into a four-party Cold War standoff. Shot on location in Morocco and New York City by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, the production drew media attention before its release for substantial cost overruns on top of a lavish budget, and reports of clashes between director, producer, and cinematographer. A change in studio management at Columbia Pictures during post-production also led to professional and personal difficulties that undermined the film's release. The film opened to mixed reviews, but became a notorious failure at the box office. An example of its polarization, Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, "The worst of it is painless; the best is funny, sly, cheerful and, here and there, even genuinely inspired," while The Chicago Sun Times' Roger Ebert called the film "truly dreadful". The film was originally released on DVD only in Europe.

PG-13 (USA)	Film Production NotesFinal Fantasy: The Spirits Within emerges from its successful interactive game roots to deliver an exciting new breed of motion picture adventure. A fresh, provocative take on the sci-fi genre, the film blends spiritual underpinnings and the universal concerns of man versus nature with the energy of the digital gaming medium and the scope of the motion picture environment.Final Fantasy game creator Hironobu Sakaguchi’s vision to take the latest in computer graphic technology and the best artists in the world to create a brand new form of entertainment now comes to the big screen—a visual feast of concept, motion, design and imagination with all-new, hyperReal characters embarking on an all-new adventure.“I have always wanted to create a new form of entertainment that fuses the technical wizardry of interactive games with the sensational visual effects of motion pictures,” says Sakaguchi. “Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within takes us one step closer to that dream.“With the flexibility of these hyperReal characters,” Sakaguchi continues, “it really opens up new doors and a whole new level of ideas and possibilities for feature films and entertainment.”Adds Chris Lee, one of the film’s producers, “We have created technology to expand the envelope of what is possible for computer-generated human characters.”Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within represents the continuing evolution of the synergy between video gaming and cinema. It is the next creative step from the trendsetting Final Fantasy game series, which has sold more than 33 million units worldwide and ranks as one of the most popular interactive game franchises of all time. Each game and the film are originated from Final Fantasy’s rich storytelling tradition and underlying themes of love, friendship, dreams, epic adventure, life and death with a spiritual backdrop. The game series is renowned for creating genuinely touching characters and relationships and for always leaving players wanting more. Each installment has started anew with fresh characters and storylines in order to present a self-contained story. “That’s the philosophy that Sakaguchi brought to the movie as well,” says Chris Lee.“This is the first time that a film inspired by a video game has been directed by the creator of the game, in the medium of the game,” he continues. “What gamers have come to love about Final Fantasy is that Sakaguchi always raises the bar in terms of the images he produces and the storylines he creates. Those are the same standards that were applied to making this movie.“This is a chance to tell a great human story in a completely different medium. Only Sakaguchi would have the vision to take what he had learned in gaming and apply it to the motion picture process,” says Lee. Yet while capturing the kind of excitement, energy and integrity presented in the phenomenally successful game series, “the film’s subject matter and plot appeals not just to gamers but to a wide audience of moviegoers.”Columbia Pictures and Square Pictures present Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Hironobu Sakaguchi directs from an original screenplay written by Al Reinert and Jeff Vintar. Story by Sakaguchi. Motonori Sakakibara co-directs. The film features the voices of actors Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, Peri Gilpin, Ming-Na, Ving Rhames, Donald Sutherland and James Woods, among others.

R (USA)	GhettoPhysics: Will the Real Pimps and Hos Please Stand Up! is a 2010 docudrama film written and directed by William Arntz and E. Raymond Brown. The film is based on Brown's 2003 book, Will The Real Pimps and Hos Please Stand Up! — Peeping the Multi-leveled Global Game. The book and the film examine the interplay between Pimps and "Hos" and how that dynamic is the oldest and simplest expression of the ways in which power is wielded in today's world. The film uses documentary footage, animation, satire and dramatization to illustrate examples culled from the "hood" to Wall Street. Whether the players are real-life pimps or corporate executives, they are all playing the “game” and repeating the same power dynamics. There have historically been many negative associations with the provocative language and images surrounding the sexual politics of the Pimp/Ho dynamic. GhettoPhysics looks closely at this reality, then goes beyond the world of prostitution to illustrate and clarify how the game is played. Weaving together theories of metaphysics and archetypal psychology, the film explains how the GhettoPhysics game crosses all races, all classes and all socio-economic levels.

R (USA)	"Won Bin’s heartthrob’s pretty boy image is shattered, tossed out, and forever lost buried under the pile of blood splattered bodies in his latest film “The Man from Nowhere” (Korean title “Ajeossi”) ― an ultra-violent ode to the hard boiled American grindhouse pictures of the 1970s.  As if channeling the spirit of Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood, Won goes on a one-man vendetta slicing, stabbing, shooting, blowing up an entire cadre of pimps, pushers, and organ harvesters to save a young girl from captivity.  For many of his fans, he may never again be seen as the clean cut, sensitive fellow from such saccharine television dramas as “Autumn in my heart.”  This film is his grand send off of the character archetype that had served him so well for an entire decade and his transition into the dark side is quite convincing.  During Tuesday’s press screening, gasps and yelps were heard sporadically from female viewers as if they were unprepared to see such carnage on the big screen. Perhaps the shock effect was magnified as a large portion of the unflinching violence came from Won’s character, the mercilessly cruel Tae-sik ― a former special agent with a harrowing past.  The film’s bloody content may turn off some fans that are not too keen on excessive screen violence, but helping alleviate some of the carnage is the stirring depiction of the film’s two social outcasts that lies at the heart of the picture.  The scenes involving Tae-sik and the little girl are ones full of charm and warmth so that once the body count begins you can’t help but root for this mad man to get her back in his loving embrace.  And since the source of his rage comes from his mission to save her from the lowest depth of the criminal underworld, it doesn’t feel too bad seeing the baddies get their comeuppance in many creatively masochistic ways.  “Of course this is an action film, but it was vital for me to amplify Tae-sik’s emotional consciousness after he loses the young girl,” Won said of his role during the post-screening Q session.  “He’s a man who has willingly cut himself off from the world because of his tragic past and it was only because of this neighborhood girl he gets back in touch with his own humanity and that was the driving force behind my performance in the film.”  Director Lee said of Won’s performance, “Those who saw the film will know better that it was evident on screen how much preparation and hard work (Won Bin) put into this role and how difficult it must have been physically for him,” and added “but with this film, it wasn’t just the physical aspects of his performance that he overcame, he also overcame the concerns voiced by his critics on whether he could pull off such an emotionally complex role.”" Quoting the program notes from the 201 Fantastic Fest site

Despite positive previews and critical response, the film was not a financial success and was considered a flop, unable to recoup its rather modest $2.8 million budget.

A romance develops between him and the camp's doctor, which attracts the anger of the camp's chief who is hoping to marry Anna, the young blond female doctor.

Film critic Philip French: "Someone says in the film that the revolutionary step they made was to progress from the usual punk group's angry statement: 'Fuck you.' Joy Division were the first to say: 'We're fucked.' There is a particularly impressive sequence in which dark, despairing tracks of urban alienation and angst from the 1979 album Unknown Pleasures are accompanied by a speeded-up nocturnal journey around Manchester. It has the hallucinatory sci-fi feeling of Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville." The person being quoted was Tony Wilson.

R (USA)	"It is 1592 and the Korea of the Joseon Dynasty is storm-tossed by political instability, moreover in the face the Japanese invasion. Foul souls are caught up in the furious winds of change. Lee Mong-hak, a master swordfighter of royal descent, leads a ruthless rebellion to supercede the country's bickering factions, repel the Japanese—and perhaps claim the throne. His old friend Hwang Jeong-hak, an ostentatiously buffoonish yet deadly blind swordsman (in the mold of Japan's beloved Zatoichi), opposes Lee's violent ambitions, and has enlisted the help of young Gyeong-ja, bastard son of a lord assassinated by Lee, who harbours his own vengeful designs. The courtesan Baek-ji pursues Lee as well, driven by a broken heart. Carried by the winds of wartime, the quartet will collide in a clash of words, wills and weapons.  Sageuk, meaning historical drama, is a cornerstone of Korean popular culture—it's even argued that 1923's STORY OF CHUNHYANG, a tale that has become a much-remade staple of sageuk cinema, was the first feature film ever shown in Japan. What's certain is that in 2005, Lee Jun-ik's gorgeous and provocative hit KING AND THE CLOWN reinvigourated the Korean public's enthusiasm for the genre. Five years later, Lee returns to sageuk terrain, adapting the immensely popular, award-winning manhwa (Korean comic serial) “Like the Moon Escaping from the Clouds.” A far more elegant title than the international BLADES OF BLOOD, though you can be assured, sharp steel and splashes of hot, wet red abound in Lee's exciting period piece. So, however, do finely wrought character drama and appealing wittiness, grand historical chronicle and astute critique of class dynamics. Of particular note is Hwang Jeong-min (BLOODY TIE, PRIVATE EYE) as the blind swordfighter, a role Lee fine-tuned just for him. As with his 2005 smash, Lee again proves that style and substance can be reconciled, as can thoughtful drama and dynamite martial arts."

G	Freaks is a 1932 horror film in which the eponymous characters were played by people who worked as carnival sideshow performers and had real deformities.

At 16 Browning had left his well-to-do family to join a traveling circus; he drew on his personal experiences for Freaks. Because of his success as the director of Dracula, he was given a considerable leeway for a major studio's first horror film; this and the fact he was working in Pre-Code Hollywood enabled a unique production. In the film, the physically deformed "freaks" are inherently trusting and honorable people, while the real monsters are two of the "normal" members of the circus who conspire to murder one of the performers to obtain his large inheritance.

R (USA)	Page One: A Year Inside the New York Times is a 2011 documentary film written by Kate Novack and  Andrew Rossi directed by Andrew Rossi.  "With the Internet surpassing print as our main news source, newspapers going bankrupt, and outlets focusing on content they claim audiences (or is it advertisers?) want, Page One chronicles the media industry’s transformation and assesses the high stakes for democracy if in-depth investigative reporting becomes extinct.  The film deftly makes a beeline for the eye of the storm or, depending on how you look at it, the inner sanctum of the media, gaining unprecedented access to the New York Times newsroom for a year. At the media desk, a dialectical play-within-a-play transpires as writers like salty David Carr track print journalism’s metamorphosis even as their own paper struggles to stay vital and solvent. Meanwhile, rigorous journalism—including vibrant cross-cubicle debate and collaboration, tenacious jockeying for on-record quotes, and skillful page-one pitching—is alive and well. The resources, intellectual capital, stamina, and self-awareness mobilized when it counts attest there are no shortcuts when analyzing and reporting complex truths." Quoting the description from the 2011 Sundance Film Festival site.

G	Departures is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yōjirō Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryōko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Aoki Shinmon, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nōkanshi—a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. The idea for Departures arose after Motoki, affected by having seen a funeral ceremony along the Ganges when travelling in India, read widely on the subject of death and came across Coffinman. He felt that the story would adapt well to film, and Departures was finished a decade later. However, because of Japanese prejudices against those who handle the dead, distributors were reluctant to release it—until a surprise grand prize win at the Montreal World Film Festival in August 2008.

PG-13 (USA)	"Former animator Andrey Khrzhanovsky combines scripted scenes, archival footage, several types of animation, and surrealist flights of fancy to create this stirring portrait of poet Joseph Brodsky and the postwar Soviet cultural scene. Exiled from his native Russia in 1972, the Nobel Prize-winning poet once claimed that if he were ever to return to the Motherland, he would do so anonymously. Stepping off from that premise, Khrzhanovsky and screenwriter Yuri Arabov have created an ironic fairy tale of a trip for Brodsky. The journey covers not only geography but time as well, as the audience is transported back to the Russia of the Fifties and Sixties to the artistic explosion that erupted in the wake of de-Stalinization and the Thaw. A Room and a Half is both a moving tribute to one of the 20th century’s major poets as well as a fascinating look at cultural life under the watchful eyes of an authoritarian regime." Quoting the synopsis on the 2009 New York Film Festival site.

R (USA)	"Some early online buzz piqued my interest enough to check out Ti West's The House of the Devil, a horror film I went into assuming it was a throwback haunted house tale, but that's not really the case. While the film is a throwback to 1980s horror it is very light on scares and rushes its final act after slow-playing it for nearly an hour. It would probably serve as a decent diversion if you are home alone one night, but if you get more than one person in a room the pacing on this one is likely to bore you to the point where sideways glances will result in one of you saying, "This is pretty dumb."  The film centers on Sam played by Jocelin Donahue, an actress that fits the description of most every Hollywood twenty-something, but she does well enough in her part considering she was given very little to do until the late going. Sam, is hard up for cash and hopes to get out of her college dorm, but is light on the funds needed to secure an apartment. So when an ad appears looking for a babysitter to take care of a creepy old man's mother she manages to up her fee to the point she is unable to turn it down, but shortly thereafter she'll wish she had.  Tom Noonan (Heat) plays the creepy old man, but his appearance and the appearance of his wife (Mary Woronov) serve as nothing more than your standard horror moment encouraging the audience to say, "Those two are creepy, I wouldn't stay there." All while the characters in the film say, "Sure, I'll take your money and care for your freaky mother." It's pretty much by-the-book and as things wind down, if you have seen a film of this sort before you will see the ending coming from a mile away.  Using a lunar eclipse as the timeline and a satanic ritual for its scares, The House of the Devil is one of those horrors that offers very little in the way of surprises outside of a single gunshot wound to the head that really had me expecting big things, but was ultimately let down from that point on." Quoting a review by Brad Brevet.

R (USA)	Tenebrae is a 1982 Italian horror thriller film written and directed by Dario Argento. The film stars Anthony Franciosa, John Saxon and Daria Nicolodi. After having experimented with two exercises in pure supernatural horror, 1977's Suspiria and 1980's Inferno, Tenebrae represented Argento's return to the giallo subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s.

R (USA)	"Mike is a locksmith. He’s also a prisoner on work release, but you wouldn’t know it. He’s just trying to focus on his house calls and reconcile with his ex-girlfriend—until Margo hijacks his day. A live-wire kook, who’s certain her boyfriend is cheating on her, Margo bulldozes Mike into spying on the alleged cad. The result: an all-day adventure with a (seemingly) stolen vehicle, a visit to an unlikely drug dealer, and a low blood-sugar attack. Potential trouble follows these two around—but maybe something good will come of it?  Codirectors (and brothers) Todd and Brad Barnes infuse screwball sensibility into their version of the romantic comedy. The chemistry between the leads is crucial: Ana Reeder revels in her free-spirited, no-boundaries role and keeps Margo likeable; Anslem Richardson is perfect as her straight man. Full of jaunty dialogue and subtle charm, Homewrecker is an irresistible and impressive debut feature." Quoting the description from the 2010 Sundance Film Festival site.

Ish wants to make it in the music biz, while Oz watches daytime cooking shows and puts his culinary skills to work impressing the grandmother of his young daughter, in hopes that his little girl will eventually come to live with him. Occasionally they visit their favorite record store, where Ish plans to buy rare R records when he gets some money, and peppers the proprietor with potential band names.

G	Branded to Kill is a 1967 Japanese yakuza film directed by Seijun Suzuki and starring Joe Shishido, Koji Nanbara, Annu Mari and Mariko Ogawa. It was a low budget, production line number for the Nikkatsu Company, originally released in a double bill with Shōgorō Nishimura's Burning Nature. The story follows Goro Hanada in his life as a contract killer. He falls in love with a woman named Misako, who recruits him for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he becomes hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, whose methods threaten his sanity as much as his life. The studio was unhappy with the original script and called in Suzuki to rewrite and direct it at the last minute. Suzuki came up with many of his ideas the night before or on the set while filming, and welcomed ideas from his collaborators. He gave the film a satirical, anarchic and visually eclectic bent which the studio had previously warned him away from. It was a commercial and critical disappointment and Suzuki was ostensibly fired for making "movies that make no sense and no money".

PG (USA)	Barbra Streisand plays a Brooklyn housewife (Henrietta Robins) so dedicated to her cabdriver husband (Michael Sarrazin) she'll do anything to help him get ahead, Streisand's character secretly borrows three thousand dollars from a loan shark so hubby can play the stock market. When an expected windfall doesn't happen, Henry becomes frantically inventive trying to raise the money to pay the shark back. Originally called July Pork Bellies (a reference to commodities futures that makes sense in the context of this story), For Pete's Sake doesn't really measure up to the aforementioned Streisand comedies, but there are certainly solid moments and individual performances to single out for praise. (Among the latter is wonderful character work by Molly Picon, Estelle Parsons, and William Redfield.) Director Yates, as has often been the case, didn't quite get his head around this sort of broad material; as comedy goes, he has proven more adept with sweeter, droller films such as Breaking Away. Despite all that, true Streisand fans will not let this get away without a look. --Tom Keogh

Bulworth's liberal views, formed in the 60s and 70s, have lost favor with voters, and so he has conceded to moderate politics and to accepting donations from special interests. In addition, though he and his wife (Christine Baranski) have been having affairs openly for years, they must still present a happy facade in the interest of maintaining a good public image. In another self-serving campaign effort, Bulworth purchases a $10 million life insurance policy in exchange for a favorable vote for his insurance company. Tired with the state of affairs and politics in general, he then orders a hit on himself to be executed within two days' time. Here, Bulworth takes a major turn, politically and personally. Knowing his time left on earth is short, he begins speaking his mind freely at public events and in the presence of the C-SPAN film crew following his campaign. His frank, potentially offensive remarks make him an instant media darling and re-energize his campaign. After becoming involved with an African American radical Nina (Halle Berry), Bulworth tries to set his sordid political track-record straight while he is pursued by the paparazzi, his insurance company, his campaign managers, Nina's protective drug-dealing brother, and an increasingly adoring public, all before his impending assassination. - From Wikipedia: removed header material

R (USA)	"This super-feel-good movie has it all - love, comedy and mouthwatering Indian food! American filmmaker David Kaplan's heart-warming tale is set in New York where Samir (Aasif Mandvi), is a top sous chef in an upmarket Manhattan restaurant, but passed over for promotion because his cuisine lacks pizzazz. Upset, he resigns; much to the surprise of his young female underchef Carrie. His parents aren't too impressed and his pestering mother (Madhur Jaffrey) is now desperate to find him a wife to sort him out. Worse still, his father gets suddenly ill and Samir has to look after their ailing, slummy Indian restaurant, when he can't even cook Indian food. In desperation Samir turns to a madcap taxi driver, Akbar (magnificently played by Naseeruddin Shah), who swears he cooked for greats like Indira Gandhi. As things get increasingly out of control, Samir unexpectedly crashes into Carrie while doubling up as the delivery boy. But Akbar's ingredients have an unexpected magic. Some great performances by a strong cast who deliver cracking humour. And the food, well - I'd suggest you eat before attending this screening!"  Quoting Cary Rajinder Sawhney

R (USA)	"Hesher is the story of a family struggling to deal with loss and the anarchist who helps them do it—in a very unexpected way.  TJ is 13 years old. Two months ago, his mom was killed in an accident, leaving TJ and his grieving dad to move in with grandma to pick up the pieces. Hesher is a loner. He hates the world—and everyone in it. He has long, greasy hair and homemade tattoos. He likes fire and blowing things up. He lives in his van—until he meets TJ.  Hesher is that rare film that manages to be a completely original vision, a thoroughly entertaining story, and a provocative metaphor. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings the character of Hesher to life with anger and angst, and Devin Brochu makes quite a splash as the young boy dealing with both the loss of his mother and an unwanted houseguest. Cowriter/director Spencer Susser crafts a multidimensional, darkly humorous film that exhibits an immensely talented storyteller at work." Quoting the description from the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.

R (USA)	Georgia is a 1995 American independent film starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham. In the film, Leigh played Sadie Flood, a punky barroom singer who has a complicated, jealous but loving relationship with her older sister, Georgia, played by Winningham. Georgia is a successful, talented and well-adjusted folk music singer and a happily married mother of two. Sadie is passionate but self-destructive and untalented. While she seeks fame, she destroys herself through drug abuse. Although the movie focuses largely on Sadie, it was apparently titled Georgia because Sadie defines her own identity so much through her older sister. John Doe of the punk band X played a supporting role and performed as a member of Sadie's band. The music in the film consisted of 13 songs which were recorded live and performed by the actors. These included covers of songs by Lou Reed, Elvis Costello and, most famously, Van Morrison: in the talked-about centrepiece of the film, Sadie drunkenly performs a raw, gruelling 8½-minute version of Morrison's "Take Me Back" in a ragged Janis Joplin-style gut howl at an AIDS benefit concert.

R (USA)	The Merchant of Venice is a 2004 romantic drama film based on Shakespeare's play of the same name. It is the first full-length sound film in English of Shakespeare's play — other versions are videotaped productions which were made for television, including John Sichel's 1973 version starring Sir Laurence Olivier as Shylock and Jack Gold's 1980 BBC production with Warren Mitchell in the role. The title character is the merchant Antonio, not the Jewish moneylender Shylock who is the more prominent character. This adaptation follows the text, but omits much. Director Michael Radford believed that Shylock was Shakespeare's first great tragic hero who reaches a catastrophe due to his own flaws. The film begins with text and a montage of how the Jewish community is abused by the Christian population of Venice and brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish ghetto in Venice. The film is a co-production between the United Kingdom, Italy, and Luxembourg.

PG-13 (USA)	Troll 2 is a 1990 comedy-horror B movie directed by Claudio Fragasso and starring Michael Stephenson, George Hardy, Margo Prey, Connie McFarland, Deborah Reed and Jason Wright. Although produced under the title Goblins, United States distributors were skeptical about the film's ability to succeed as a standalone picture and renamed it Troll 2 in an attempt to market it as a sequel to the 1986 Empire Pictures film Troll. The two films, however, have no connection, and no trolls are actually depicted in Troll 2. The plot concerns a family pursued by vegetarian goblins who seek to transform them into plants so that they can eat them. The English-language script was written by Fragasso and his wife Rosella Drudi, neither of whom actually spoke fluent English at the time. Despite filming the movie in Utah, and casting the movie entirely with American actors, Fragasso also employed an exclusively Italian crew, who likewise spoke no English. The resultant communication breakdown, coupled with the cast's lack of experience and Fragasso's insistence that his script be performed verbatim, has led to the movie being considered one of the worst movies ever made.

R (USA)	Rubber is a 2010 film written and directed by Quentin Dupieux.  "Quentin Dupieux (aka Mr. Oizo) first entered the public conscious when his thumping techno track "Flat Beat" was released in 1999. The related music video and TV commercials featuring a yellow puppet named Flat Eric were also hugely successful. Dupieux went on to write and direct full-length films. His latest feature is Rubber, a wonderfully weird movie about — among other things — a tire that comes to life.  Rubber begins in a desert. A series of chairs are laid out in a zig-zag pattern on a barren road. A man with a pair of binoculars anxiously stands by the road. A car becomes visible in the distance. As the car moves closer, the driver purposely begins to knock over the chairs. The car halts and a policeman emerges. He delivers a monologue and quickly disappears. The camera pulls back to reveal that a group of people was watching the entire sequence of events. The people are waiting for a movie to begin. A movie about a car tire named Robert that inexplicably comes to life. Robert realizes that he has powers. Psychic powers. Psychic powers that make things explode. Things like bottles. Things like rabbits. Things like human heads.   As one might surmise from the description, Rubber presents two interconnected stories. One story is about the adventures of Robert the tire. The other is about a group of people watching a movie about the adventures of Robert the tire. If this sounds confusing, don't be alarmed. It is confusing. It is also ingenious. Rubber operates as both an homage to genre and a dissection of its logical innards. The film gleefully plays with a core cinematic conceit: suspension of disbelief. Screenwriters ask often ask the audience to accept the most unreal situations at face value. If stories about cyborgs, talking animals, walking corpses, and sentient bulldozers pass muster, why not a murderous tire with psychic powers?   Quentin Dupieux executes this prankish self-reflexive story with style and precision. The film obviously has a dark comedic edge but everything is played straight. Mostly. The performers, who include Wings Hauser and Roxanne Medina, absorb the parade of exploding heads, murders, sight gags, and improbable situations with stone-face austerity. The utterly deadpan approach is crucial to making the concept work. After awhile, the abnormal becomes normal. One character says that "I never thought I'd identify with a tire." The audience will feel the same way. By the end, everyone will cheer Robert. Even if he is popping skulls like birthday balloons." Quoting the program notes from the 2010 Fantastic Fest site.

Warner Bros. developed a script with writer Sam Hamm which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after he granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with Daniel Waters. Wesley Strick did an uncredited rewrite, removing the characters of Harvey Dent and Robin and rewriting the climax.

R (USA)	The Guard is a 2011 comedy/thriller film written and directed by John Michael McDonagh.  "Sergeant Gerry Boyle, a salty village cop in Ireland, has a subversive sense of humor, a caustic wit, and an uncanny knack for keeping people at arm’s length. When a straitlaced FBI agent chasing an international drug-smuggling ring hits town, Boyle has no intention of letting the arrival disrupt his routine of hookers and wisecracks. Initially, he relishes offending and ridiculing the agent, but a murder and a series of peculiar events draw the reluctant sergeant into the investigation. John Michael McDonagh’s crisply written debut feature transcends the rules of the buddy cop comedy, wryly offering genuine humor and thrills against an unexpectedly moving portrait of its protagonist. Brendan Gleeson’s beguiling portrayal of Boyle defies easy definition as hero or buffoon, hinting instead at the lonely, intelligent man behind the sharp retorts. The Guard is a clever, fresh character study, as well as a snappy joyride of an action comedy." Quoting the description from the 2011 Sundance Film Festival site.

R (USA)	40 Day Dream is a 2010 comedy drama romance film written by Olly Alexander,Alison Bagnall,Greta Gerwig and Andrew Lewis and directed by Alison Bagnall.  "Emotionally unhinged after leaving her cheating husband, Rose runs off to drink away her sorrow in an abandoned lighthouse, where she stumbles on a similarly jilted and listless English boy. The two wounded souls fall in with each other, taking shelter in a deserted beach house. There they revert to childlike states in an effort to escape their adult anguish. The two shirk responsibilities in favor of binge-drinking, aimless wandering and playacting while conspiring to find and take revenge upon the woman who slept with Rose’s husband. In the process, they play a game in which they act out the roles of a happy couple. But the game may mean different things to Rose and her new friend. Under the moody gray skies of off-season coastal Delaware, indie star Greta Gerwig (Greenberg, 2010) delivers a fearlessly unrestrained performance, with an endearing vulnerability that matches her paroxysms of grief. In contrast, newcomer Olly Alexander—looking like a Don’t Look Back–era Bob Dylan—bears his character’s suffering more quietly, hinting at his torment through ironic distance. Together, the unlikely pair creates a stirring portrayal of young adults still learning to cope with the heartbreak that stems from being betrayed by the ones you love the most. Alison Bagnall, who most recently acted in two films by Joe Swanberg, employs a similarly low-key directing style while taking an emotionally direct approach that’s all her own. The Dish & the Spoon is a quirky and potent story of the unavoidable perils of emotional dependency." Quoting Jesse Dubus from the 2011 San Francisco International Film Festival site.

PG-13 (USA)	Bring It On: In It to Win It is a 2007 teen film directed by Steve Rash and starring Ashley Benson, Michael Copon and Cassie Scerbo.

It was released direct-to-video on 18 December 2007 in the United States and had a television premier on 20 January 2008 on ABC Family. This film has a tenuous link to the previous films in the series, featuring only a similar plot of competitive cheer teams that have to try something different in order to win. There are no recurring cast members or canonical references to the previous films. Only Steve Rash, who also directed the previous film, All or Nothing, returns to direct this sequel. The film stylistically refers to its predecessors in that it opens with a choreographed routine that turns out to be a dream sequence of the protagonist and the end credits feature outtakes and clips of the cast having fun dancing.

The film is one of two released in 1976 that were based on a real illegal cross-continent road race that took place for a number of years in the United States. The same topic later became the basis for the films The Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II and Speed Zone!. The film was written and directed by Paul Bartel, who also directed Death Race 2000. The name of the film and the plot were inspired by Erwin G.

PG (USA)	The Hindenburg is a 1975 American Technicolor film based on the disaster of the German airship Hindenburg. The film stars George C. Scott. It was produced and directed by Robert Wise, and was written by Nelson Gidding, Richard Levinson and William Link, based on the 1972 book of the same name, The Hindenburg, by Michael M. Mooney. A. A. Hoehling, author of the 1962 book Who Destroyed The Hindenburg?, also about the sabotage theory, sued Mooney along with the film developers for copyright infringement as well as unfair competition. However, Judge Charles M. Metzner dismissed his allegations. A highly speculative thriller, The Hindenburg depicts a conspiracy leading to the destruction of the airship. In reality, while the Zeppelins were certainly used as a propaganda symbol by the Third Reich, and anti-Nazi forces might have had the motivation for sabotage, the theory of sabotage was investigated at the time, and no firm evidence for such sabotage was ever put forward. The possibility of Boerth's deliberate sabotage is one theory of the fire that had been the subject of Mooney's book, published around the time of the film's development.
PG-13 (USA)	Young Guns II is a 1990 western film, and the sequel to Young Guns. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian Slater, and features William Petersen as Pat Garrett.

It follows the life of Billy the Kid, in the years following the Lincoln County War in which Billy was part of "The Regulators" – a group of around 6 highly skilled gunmen avenging the death of John Tunstall – and the years before Billy's documented death. The film, however, is told by Brushy Bill Roberts, a man who in the 1940s appeared claiming to be the real Billy the Kid. While the film takes some creative license, it does show some of the key events leading up to Billy's documented death, including his talks with Governor Lew Wallace, his capture by friend-turned-foe Pat Garrett, his trial and his subsequent escape in which he killed two deputies.

It has him accidentally unleashing an army of trolls upon a small town on Halloween and the plot involves him joining a few children in fighting back. It was shot in Nashville, Tennessee like its predecessors Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam, Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest Saves Christmas, and Ernest Goes to Jail. Due to its modest gross of $14,143,280 at the U.S. box office, it was the final Ernest film to be released under the Disney label Touchstone Pictures. All future Ernest films were independently produced, and following the financial failure of the theatrical release Ernest Rides Again, the Ernest films shifted to a straight-to-video market. Its opening credits feature a montage of clips from various horror and science fiction films. It is highly likely that they were used more for their public domain status rather than their fame.

In 1950, a group of student Scottish nationalists succeeded in removing it from Westminster Abbey and returning it to Scotland where it was placed symbolically at Arbroath Abbey, the site of the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath and an important site in the Scottish nationalist cause.

R (USA)	Shiri is a 1999 South Korean action film, written and directed by Kang Je-gyu. Swiri was the first Hollywood-style big-budget blockbuster to be produced in the "new" Korean film industry. Created as a deliberate homage to the "high-octane" action film made popular by Hollywood through 1980s, it also contained a story that draws on strong Korean national sentiment to fuel its drama. Much of the film's visual style shares that of the Asian action cinema, and particularly Hong Kong action cinema, of John Woo, Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam, and the relentless pace of the second unit directors, like Vic Armstrong and Guy Hamilton, in the James Bond films. The movie was released under the name Shiri outside of South Korea; in Korea, the title was spelled Swiri. The name refers to Coreoleuciscus splendidus, a fish found in Korean fresh-water streams. At one point Park has a monologue wherein he describes how the waters from both North and South Korea flow freely together, and how the fish can be found in either water without knowing which it belongs to. This ties into the film's ambitions to be the first major-release film to directly address the still-thorny issue of Korean reunification.

The film’s cast includes Lili Taylor, Juliette Lewis, Christopher Bowen and Courtney Jines. Barbara Wilson's novel is the winner of a British Crime Writers' Award for Best Mystery Based in Europe and a Lambda Literary Award.

R (USA)	"The polished rooms of a Milanese villa ignite with anxious activity as the wealthy industrial family, the Recchis, prepare to celebrate the birthday of their patriarch. It is an occasion designed to ensconce family traditions—the handsome grandson, Edoardo, introduces his new girlfriend; his sister presents another piece of her artwork to her grandfather; and the grandfather, knowing this is his last birthday, names the successor to his empire. As the refined familial machinations unfold, the woman of the house, Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), skates along the tight seams of the family, exuding elegance and uncertain turbulence. Change is like a fog at sea that quickly consumes the land.  A feast for the senses, Luca Guadagnino’s magnificent film, I Am Love, possesses a vibrant and formally irreverent style that luminously articulates its themes of passion and constraint. Swinton turns in a stunning performance as the central muse of a tale about the irresistible draw of forbidden passion and the bittersweet victory of liberation from the constrictions of wealth and power." Quoting the description from the 2010 Sundance Film Festival site.

His last known film project, "Meth" filmed in and around Palmdale/Lancaster CA involved a film "completion fund" scam where he ran off with the Sony Camera equipment loaned to him and the money he had collected from several investors. Upon returning to CA, he eventually died awaiting a liver transplant in 2001, without ever contacting his sons. Christopher Walken bore an uncanny resemblance to Robert Jordan both in the physical and in his ability to appear menacing and unpredictable.

PG-13 (USA)	One morning, a seemingly average and generally solitary IRS agent named Harold Crick begins to hear a female voice narrating his every action, thought and feeling in alarmingly precise detail. Harold’s carefully controlled life is turned upside down by this narration only he can hear, and when the voice declares that Harold Crick is facing imminent death, he realizes he must find out who is writing his story and persuade her to change the ending. The voice in Harold’s head turns out to be the once celebrated, but now nearly forgotten, novelist Karen "Kay" Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who is struggling to find an ending for what might be her best book. Her only remaining challenge is to figure out a way to kill her main character, but little does she know that Harold Crick is alive and well and inexplicably aware of her words and her plans for him. To make matters worse, Kay’s publisher has dispatched a hard-nosed "assistant," Penny Escher (Queen Latifah), to force Kay to finish her novel and finish off Harold Crick. Desperate to take control of his destiny and avoid an untimely demise, Harold seeks help from a literary theorist named Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who suggests that Harold might be able to change his fate by turning his story from a tragedy into a comedy. Professor Hilbert suggests that Harold try to follow one of comedy’s most elemental formulas: a love story between two people who hate each other. His suggestion leads Harold to initiate an unlikely romance with a free-spirited baker named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). As Harold experiences true love and true life for the first time, he becomes convinced that he has escaped his fate, as his story seems to be taking on all the trappings of a comedy in which he will not, and cannot, die. But Harold is unaware that in a Karen Eiffel tragedy, the lead characters always die at exactly the moment when they have the most to live for. Harold and Kay find themselves in unexplored territory as each must weigh the value of a single human existence against what might just be an immortal work of art: a novel about life and death -- and taxes.

Warner Bros. president Mark Tappin and the film's producers then demanded script re-writes and re-shoots, which included filming gorier death scenes and nightmare sequences, similar to the ones from Craven's previous horror hit, A Nightmare on Elm Street. Due to studio imposed re-shoots and re-editing, the movie was drastically altered in post-production, losing much of the original plot and more scenes between characters, while other scenes, including bloodier death scenes and a new ending, were added.

Having been struck by the cinematic qualities of Sondheim's musical while still a student, Burton had entertained the notion of a film version since the early 1980s.
